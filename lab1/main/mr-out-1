PREFACE 1
Most 1
of 1
the 1
adventures 1
recorded 1
in 1
this 1
book 1
really 1
occurred 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
were 1
experiences 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
the 1
rest 1
those 1
of 1
boys 1
who 1
were 1
schoolmates 1
of 1
mine 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
is 1
drawn 1
from 1
life 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
also 1
but 1
not 1
from 1
an 1
individual 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
combination 1
of 1
the 1
characteristics 1
of 1
three 1
boys 1
whom 1
I 1
knew 1
and 1
therefore 1
belongs 1
to 1
the 1
composite 1
order 1
of 1
architecture 1
The 1
odd 1
superstitions 1
touched 1
upon 1
were 1
all 1
prevalent 1
among 1
children 1
and 1
slaves 1
in 1
the 1
West 1
at 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
this 1
story 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
thirty 1
or 1
forty 1
years 1
ago 1
Although 1
my 1
book 1
is 1
intended 1
mainly 1
for 1
the 1
entertainment 1
of 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
I 1
hope 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
shunned 1
by 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
on 1
that 1
account 1
for 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
plan 1
has 1
been 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
pleasantly 1
remind 1
adults 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
once 1
were 1
themselves 1
and 1
of 1
how 1
they 1
felt 1
and 1
thought 1
and 1
talked 1
and 1
what 1
queer 1
enterprises 1
they 1
sometimes 1
engaged 1
in 1

No 1

The 1
old 1
lady 1
pulled 1
her 1
spectacles 1
down 1
and 1
looked 1
over 1
them 1
about 1
the 1
room 1
then 1
she 1
put 1
them 1
up 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
under 1
them 1
She 1
seldom 1
or 1
never 1
looked 1
through 1
them 1
for 1
so 1
small 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
boy 1
they 1
were 1
her 1
state 1
pair 1
the 1
pride 1
of 1
her 1
heart 1
and 1
were 1
built 1
for 1
style 1
not 1
service 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
seen 1
through 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
stove 1
lids 1
just 1
as 1
well 1
She 1
looked 1
perplexed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
not 1
fiercely 1
but 1
still 1
loud 1
enough 1
for 1
the 1
furniture 1
to 1
hear 1
Well 1
I 1
lay 1
if 1
I 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
ll 1
She 1
did 1
not 1
finish 1
for 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
was 1
bending 1
down 1
and 1
punching 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
with 1
the 1
broom 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
needed 1
breath 1
to 1
punctuate 1
the 1
punches 1
with 1
She 1
resurrected 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
I 1
never 1
did 1
see 1
the 1
beat 1
of 1
that 1
boy 1
She 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
open 1
door 1
and 1
stood 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
among 1
the 1
tomato 1
vines 1
and 1
jimpson 1
weeds 1
that 1
constituted 1
the 1
garden 1
No 1
Tom 1
So 1
she 1
lifted 1
up 1
her 1
voice 1
at 1
an 1
angle 1
calculated 1
for 1
distance 1
and 1
shouted 1
Y 1

TOM 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
slight 1
noise 1
behind 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
turned 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
seize 1
a 1
small 1
boy 1
by 1
the 1
slack 1
of 1
his 1
roundabout 1
and 1
arrest 1
his 1
flight 1
There 1
I 1
might 1
a 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
closet 1
What 1
you 1
been 1
doing 1
in 1
there 1
Nothing 1
Nothing 1
Look 1
at 1
your 1
hands 1
And 1
look 1
at 1
your 1
mouth 1
What 1
is 1

truck 1
I 1
don 1

Well 1
I 1
know 1
It 1

is 1
Forty 1
times 1
I 1

said 1

jam 1
alone 1
I 1

Hand 1

The 1
switch 1
hovered 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
the 1
peril 1
was 1
desperate 1
My 1
Look 1
behind 1
you 1
aunt 1
The 1
old 1
lady 1
whirled 1
round 1
and 1
snatched 1
her 1
skirts 1
out 1
of 1
danger 1
The 1
lad 1
fled 1
on 1
the 1
instant 1
scrambled 1
up 1
the 1
high 1
board 1
fence 1
and 1
disappeared 1
over 1
it 1
His 1
aunt 1
Polly 1
stood 1
surprised 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
gentle 1
laugh 1
Hang 1
the 1
boy 1
can 1
t 1
I 1
never 1
learn 1
anything 1
Ain 1
t 1
he 1
played 1
me 1
tricks 1
enough 1
like 1
that 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
looking 1
out 1
for 1
him 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
But 1

Can 1

But 1

He 1

how 1
long 1

torment 1
me 1
before 1
I 1

my 1
dander 1
up 1
and 1

knows 1
if 1
he 1
can 1
make 1
out 1
to 1
put 1
me 1
off 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
make 1
me 1
laugh 1

s 1
all 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
I 1

lick 1
I 1

doing 1
my 1
duty 1
by 1
that 1
boy 1
and 1

Spare 1

Good 1
Book 1

I 1

a 1
laying 1
up 1
sin 1
and 1
suffering 1
for 1

I 1

He 1

of 1
the 1
Old 1
Scratch 1

he 1
s 1
my 1
own 1
dead 1
sister 1

boy 1
poor 1
thing 1
and 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
the 1
heart 1
to 1
lash 1
him 1
somehow 1
Every 1
time 1
I 1
let 1
him 1
off 1
my 1
conscience 1
does 1
hurt 1
me 1
so 1
and 1
every 1
time 1
I 1
hit 1
him 1
my 1
old 1
heart 1
most 1
breaks 1
Well 1
a 1
well 1
man 1
that 1
is 1
born 1
of 1
woman 1
is 1
of 1
few 1
days 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
trouble 1
as 1
the 1
Scripture 1
says 1
and 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
s 1
so 1
He 1
ll 1
play 1
hookey 1
this 1
evening 1
and 1
Southwestern 1
for 1
afternoon 1
I 1
ll 1
just 1
be 1
obleeged 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
work 1
tomorrow 1
to 1
punish 1
him 1
It 1
s 1
mighty 1
hard 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
work 1
Saturdays 1
when 1
all 1
the 1
boys 1
is 1
having 1
holiday 1
but 1
he 1
hates 1
work 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
hates 1
anything 1
else 1
and 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
some 1
of 1
my 1
duty 1
by 1
him 1
or 1
I 1
ll 1
be 1
the 1
ruination 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
Tom 1
did 1
play 1
hookey 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
time 1
He 1
got 1
back 1
home 1
barely 1
in 1
season 1
to 1
help 1
Jim 1
the 1
small 1
colored 1
boy 1
saw 1
next 1
day 1
s 1
wood 1
and 1
split 1
the 1
kindlings 1
before 1
supper 1
at 1
least 1
he 1
was 1
there 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
adventures 1
to 1
Jim 1
while 1
Jim 1
did 1
three 1
fourths 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
Tom 1
s 1
younger 1
brother 1
or 1
rather 1
half 1
brother 1
Sid 1
was 1
already 1
through 1
with 1
his 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
work 1
picking 1
up 1
chips 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
quiet 1
boy 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
adventurous 1
trouble 1
some 1
ways 1
While 1
Tom 1
was 1
eating 1
his 1
supper 1
and 1
stealing 1
sugar 1
as 1
opportunity 1
offered 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
asked 1
him 1
questions 1
that 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
guile 1
and 1
very 1
deep 1
for 1
she 1
wanted 1
to 1
trap 1
him 1
into 1
damaging 1
revealments 1
Like 1
many 1
other 1
simple 1
hearted 1
souls 1
it 1
was 1
her 1
pet 1
vanity 1
to 1
believe 1
she 1
was 1
endowed 1
with 1
a 1
talent 1
for 1
dark 1
and 1
mysterious 1
diplomacy 1
and 1
she 1
loved 1
to 1
contemplate 1
her 1
most 1
transparent 1
devices 1
as 1
marvels 1
of 1
low 1
cunning 1
Said 1
she 1
Tom 1
it 1
was 1
middling 1
warm 1
in 1
school 1
warn 1
t 1
it 1
Yes 1
m 1
Powerful 1
warm 1
warn 1
t 1
it 1
Yes 1
m 1
Didn 1
t 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
a 1
swimming 1
Tom 1
A 1
bit 1
of 1
a 1
scare 1
shot 1
through 1
Tom 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
uncomfortable 1
suspicion 1
He 1
searched 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
face 1
but 1
it 1
told 1
him 1
nothing 1
So 1
he 1
said 1
No 1
m 1
well 1
not 1
very 1
much 1
The 1
old 1
lady 1
reached 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
felt 1
Tom 1
s 1
shirt 1
and 1
said 1
But 1
you 1
ain 1
t 1
too 1
warm 1
now 1
though 1
And 1
it 1
flattered 1
her 1
to 1
reflect 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
discovered 1
that 1
the 1
shirt 1
was 1
dry 1
without 1
anybody 1
knowing 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
in 1
her 1
mind 1
But 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
her 1
Tom 1
knew 1
where 1
the 1
wind 1
lay 1
now 1
So 1
he 1
forestalled 1
what 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
next 1
move 1
Some 1
of 1
us 1
pumped 1
on 1
our 1
heads 1
mine 1
s 1
damp 1
yet 1
See 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
was 1
vexed 1
to 1
think 1
she 1
had 1
overlooked 1
that 1
bit 1
of 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
and 1
missed 1
a 1
trick 1
Then 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
new 1
inspiration 1
Tom 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
undo 1
your 1
shirt 1
collar 1
where 1
I 1
sewed 1
it 1
to 1
pump 1
on 1
your 1
head 1
did 1
you 1
Unbutton 1
your 1
jacket 1
The 1
trouble 1
vanished 1
out 1
of 1
Tom 1
s 1
face 1
He 1
opened 1
his 1
jacket 1
His 1
shirt 1
collar 1
was 1
securely 1
sewed 1
Bother 1
Well 1
go 1
long 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
d 1
made 1
sure 1
you 1
d 1
played 1
hookey 1
and 1
been 1
a 1
swimming 1
But 1
I 1
forgive 1
ye 1
Tom 1
I 1
reckon 1
you 1
re 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
singed 1
cat 1
as 1
the 1
saying 1
is 1
better 1
n 1
you 1
look 1
This 1
time 1
She 1
was 1
half 1
sorry 1
her 1
sagacity 1
had 1
miscarried 1
and 1
half 1
glad 1
that 1
Tom 1
had 1
stumbled 1
into 1
obedient 1
conduct 1
for 1
once 1
But 1
Sidney 1
said 1
Well 1
now 1
if 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
you 1
sewed 1
his 1
collar 1
with 1
white 1
thread 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
black 1
Why 1
I 1
did 1
sew 1
it 1
with 1
white 1
Tom 1
But 1
Tom 1
did 1
not 1
wait 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
As 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
said 1
Siddy 1
I 1
ll 1
lick 1
you 1
for 1
that 1
In 1
a 1
safe 1
place 1
Tom 1
examined 1
two 1
large 1
needles 1
which 1
were 1
thrust 1
into 1
the 1
lapels 1
of 1
his 1
jacket 1
and 1
had 1
thread 1
bound 1
about 1
them 1
one 1
needle 1
carried 1
white 1
thread 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
black 1
He 1
said 1
She 1
d 1
never 1
noticed 1
if 1
it 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
for 1
Sid 1
Confound 1
it 1
sometimes 1
she 1
sews 1
it 1
with 1
white 1
and 1
sometimes 1
she 1
sews 1
it 1
with 1
black 1
I 1
wish 1
to 1
gee 1
miny 1
she 1
d 1
stick 1
to 1
one 1
or 1
t 1
other 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
keep 1
the 1
run 1
of 1
em 1
But 1
I 1
bet 1
you 1
I 1
ll 1
lam 1
Sid 1
for 1
that 1
I 1
ll 1
learn 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
Model 1
Boy 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
He 1
knew 1
the 1
model 1
boy 1
very 1
well 1
though 1
and 1
loathed 1
him 1
Within 1
two 1
minutes 1
or 1
even 1
less 1
he 1
had 1
forgotten 1
all 1
his 1
troubles 1
Not 1
because 1
his 1
troubles 1
were 1
one 1
whit 1
less 1
heavy 1
and 1
bitter 1
to 1
him 1
than 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
are 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
but 1
because 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
powerful 1
interest 1
bore 1
them 1
down 1
and 1
drove 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
just 1
as 1
men 1
s 1
misfortunes 1
are 1
forgotten 1
in 1
the 1
excitement 1
of 1
new 1
enterprises 1
This 1
new 1
interest 1
was 1
a 1
valued 1
novelty 1
in 1
whistling 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
acquired 1
from 1
a 1
negro 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
suffering 1
to 1
practise 1
it 1
un 1
disturbed 1
It 1
consisted 1
in 1
a 1
peculiar 1
bird 1
like 1
turn 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
liquid 1
warble 1
produced 1
by 1
touching 1
the 1
tongue 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
mouth 1
at 1
short 1
intervals 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
the 1
music 1
the 1
reader 1
probably 1
remembers 1
how 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
he 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
a 1
boy 1
Diligence 1
and 1
attention 1
soon 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
knack 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
strode 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
his 1
mouth 1
full 1
of 1
harmony 1
and 1
his 1
soul 1
full 1
of 1
gratitude 1
He 1
felt 1
much 1
as 1
an 1
astronomer 1
feels 1
who 1
has 1
discovered 1
a 1
new 1
planet 1
no 1
doubt 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
strong 1
deep 1
unalloyed 1
pleasure 1
is 1
concerned 1
the 1
advantage 1
was 1
with 1
the 1
boy 1
not 1
the 1
astronomer 1
The 1
summer 1
evenings 1
were 1
long 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
dark 1
yet 1
Presently 1
Tom 1
checked 1
his 1
whistle 1
A 1
stranger 1
was 1
before 1
him 1
a 1
boy 1
a 1
shade 1
larger 1
than 1
himself 1
A 1
new 1
comer 1
of 1
any 1
age 1
or 1
either 1
sex 1
was 1
an 1
im 1
pressive 1
curiosity 1
in 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
shabby 1
village 1
of 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
This 1
boy 1
was 1
well 1
dressed 1
too 1
well 1
dressed 1
on 1
a 1
week 1
day 1
This 1
was 1
simply 1
as 1
astounding 1
His 1
cap 1
was 1
a 1
dainty 1
thing 1
his 1
close 1
buttoned 1
blue 1
cloth 1
roundabout 1
was 1
new 1
and 1
natty 1
and 1
so 1
were 1
his 1
pantaloons 1
He 1
had 1
shoes 1
on 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
Friday 1
He 1
even 1
wore 1
a 1
necktie 1
a 1
bright 1
bit 1
of 1
ribbon 1
He 1
had 1
a 1
citified 1
air 1
about 1
him 1
that 1
ate 1
into 1
Tom 1
s 1
vitals 1
The 1
more 1
Tom 1
stared 1
at 1
the 1
splendid 1
marvel 1
the 1
higher 1
he 1
turned 1
up 1
his 1
nose 1
at 1
his 1
finery 1
and 1
the 1
shabbier 1
and 1
shabbier 1
his 1
own 1
outfit 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
grow 1
Neither 1
boy 1
spoke 1
If 1
one 1
moved 1
the 1
other 1
moved 1
but 1
only 1
sidewise 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
they 1
kept 1
face 1
to 1
face 1
and 1
eye 1
to 1
eye 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
Finally 1
Tom 1
said 1
I 1
can 1
lick 1
you 1
I 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
you 1
try 1
it 1
Well 1
I 1
can 1
do 1
it 1
No 1
you 1
can 1
t 1

Yes 1
I 1
can 1
No 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
I 1
can 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
Can 1
Can 1
t 1
An 1
uncomfortable 1
pause 1
Then 1
Tom 1
said 1
What 1
s 1
your 1
name 1
Tisn 1
t 1
any 1
of 1
your 1
business 1
maybe 1
Well 1
I 1
low 1
I 1
ll 1
make 1
it 1
my 1
business 1
Well 1
why 1

t 1

If 1

say 1

I 1
will 1
Much 1

There 1
now 1
Oh 1

think 1
you 1
re 1
mighty 1
smart 1

t 1

I 1
could 1
lick 1
you 1
with 1
one 1
hand 1
tied 1
behind 1
me 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
Well 1
why 1
don 1
t 1

do 1

You 1
say 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
it 1
Well 1
I 1
will 1
if 1
you 1
fool 1
with 1
me 1
Oh 1
yes 1
I 1
ve 1
seen 1

families 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
fix 1
Smarty 1
You 1
think 1

t 1

Oh 1

You 1

t 1

I 1
dare 1

to 1
knock 1
it 1
off 1
and 1
anybody 1
that 1
ll 1
take 1
a 1
dare 1
will 1
suck 1
eggs 1
You 1
re 1
a 1
liar 1
You 1
re 1

You 1
re 1
a 1
fighting 1
liar 1
and 1
dasn 1
t 1
take 1

up 1
Aw 1
take 1
a 1
walk 1
Say 1
if 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
much 1
more 1
of 1
your 1
sass 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
and 1
bounce 1
a 1
rock 1
off 1
n 1
your 1
head 1
Oh 1
of 1

Well 1
I 1
will 1
Well 1
why 1

What 1

Why 1

because 1

I 1
ain 1
t 1
afraid 1
You 1
are 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
You 1
are 1
Another 1
pause 1
and 1
more 1
eying 1
and 1
sidling 1
around 1
each 1
other 1
Presently 1
they 1
were 1
shoulder 1
to 1
shoulder 1
Tom 1
said 1
Get 1
away 1
from 1
here 1
Go 1
away 1
yourself 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
either 1
So 1
they 1
stood 1
each 1
with 1
a 1
foot 1
placed 1
at 1
an 1
angle 1
as 1
a 1
brace 1
and 1
both 1
shoving 1
with 1
might 1
and 1
main 1
and 1
glowering 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
hate 1
But 1
neither 1
could 1
get 1
an 1
advantage 1
After 1
struggling 1
till 1
both 1
were 1
hot 1
and 1
flushed 1
each 1
relaxed 1
his 1
strain 1
with 1
watchful 1
caution 1
and 1
Tom 1
said 1
You 1
re 1
a 1
coward 1
and 1
a 1
pup 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
my 1
big 1
brother 1
on 1
you 1
and 1
he 1
can 1
thrash 1
you 1
with 1
his 1
little 1

Both 1

imaginary 1
That 1

Your 1

Tom 1
drew 1
a 1
line 1
in 1
the 1
dust 1
with 1
his 1
big 1
toe 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
dare 1
you 1
to 1
step 1
over 1
that 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
lick 1
you 1
till 1

t 1
stand 1
up 1
Anybody 1
that 1
ll 1
take 1
a 1
dare 1
will 1
steal 1
sheep 1
The 1
new 1
boy 1
stepped 1
over 1
promptly 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
you 1
said 1
you 1
d 1

Well 1

said 1
you 1
d 1

t 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
By 1
jingo 1
for 1
two 1
cents 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
The 1
new 1
boy 1
took 1
two 1
broad 1
coppers 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
held 1
them 1
out 1
with 1
derision 1
Tom 1
struck 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
In 1
an 1
instant 1
both 1
boys 1
were 1
rolling 1
and 1
tumbling 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
gripped 1
together 1
like 1
cats 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
a 1
minute 1
they 1
tugged 1
and 1
tore 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
hair 1
and 1
clothes 1
punched 1
and 1
scratched 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
nose 1
and 1
covered 1
themselves 1
with 1
dust 1
and 1
glory 1
Presently 1
the 1
confusion 1
took 1
form 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
fog 1
of 1
battle 1
Tom 1
appeared 1
seated 1
astride 1
the 1
new 1
boy 1
and 1
pounding 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
fists 1
Holler 1
nuff 1
said 1
he 1
The 1
boy 1
only 1
struggled 1
to 1
free 1
himself 1
He 1
was 1
crying 1
mainly 1
from 1
rage 1
Holler 1
nuff 1
and 1
the 1
pounding 1
went 1
on 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
stranger 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
smothered 1
Nuff 1
and 1
Tom 1
let 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
that 1
ll 1
learn 1
you 1
Better 1
look 1
out 1
who 1
you 1
re 1
fooling 1
with 1
next 1
time 1
The 1
new 1
boy 1
went 1
off 1
brushing 1
the 1
dust 1
from 1
his 1
clothes 1
sobbing 1
snuffling 1
and 1
occasionally 1
looking 1
back 1
and 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
threatening 1
what 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
to 1
Tom 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
he 1
caught 1
him 1
out 1
To 1
which 1
Tom 1
responded 1
with 1
jeers 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
in 1
high 1
feather 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
his 1
back 1
was 1
turned 1
the 1
new 1
boy 1
snatched 1
up 1
a 1
stone 1
threw 1
it 1
and 1
hit 1
him 1
between 1
the 1
shoulders 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
tail 1
and 1
ran 1
like 1
an 1
antelope 1
Tom 1
chased 1
the 1
traitor 1
home 1
and 1
thus 1
found 1
out 1
where 1
he 1
lived 1
He 1
then 1
held 1
a 1
position 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
daring 1
the 1
enemy 1
to 1
come 1
outside 1
but 1
the 1
enemy 1
only 1
made 1
faces 1
at 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
declined 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
enemy 1
s 1
mother 1
appeared 1
and 1
called 1
Tom 1
a 1
bad 1
vicious 1
vulgar 1
child 1
and 1
ordered 1
him 1
away 1
So 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
but 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
lowed 1
to 1
lay 1
for 1
that 1
boy 1
He 1
got 1
home 1
pretty 1
late 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
climbed 1
cautiously 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
he 1
uncovered 1
an 1
ambuscade 1
in 1
the 1
person 1
of 1
his 1
aunt 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
state 1
his 1
clothes 1
were 1
in 1
her 1
resolution 1
to 1
turn 1
his 1
Saturday 1
holiday 1
into 1
captivity 1
at 1
hard 1
labor 1
became 1
adamantine 1
in 1
its 1
firmness 1
CHAPTER 1
II 1
SATURDAY 1
morning 1
was 1
come 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
summer 1
world 1
was 1
bright 1
and 1
fresh 1
and 1
brimming 1
with 1
life 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
song 1
in 1
every 1
heart 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
heart 1
was 1
young 1
the 1
music 1
issued 1
at 1
the 1
lips 1
There 1
was 1
cheer 1
in 1
every 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
spring 1
in 1
every 1
step 1
The 1
locust 1
trees 1
were 1
in 1
bloom 1
and 1
the 1
fragrance 1
of 1
the 1
blossoms 1
filled 1
the 1
air 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
beyond 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
above 1
it 1
was 1
green 1
with 1
vegetation 1
and 1
it 1
lay 1
just 1
far 1
enough 1
away 1
to 1
seem 1
a 1
Delectable 1
Land 1
dreamy 1
reposeful 1
and 1
inviting 1
Tom 1
appeared 1
on 1
the 1
sidewalk 1
with 1
a 1
bucket 1
of 1
whitewash 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
handled 1
brush 1
He 1
surveyed 1
the 1
fence 1
and 1
all 1
gladness 1
left 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
deep 1
melancholy 1
settled 1
down 1
upon 1
his 1
spirit 1
Thirty 1
yards 1
of 1
board 1
fence 1
nine 1
feet 1
high 1
Life 1
to 1
him 1
seemed 1
hollow 1
and 1
existence 1
but 1
a 1
burden 1
Sighing 1
he 1
dipped 1
his 1
brush 1
and 1
passed 1
it 1
along 1
the 1
topmost 1
plank 1
repeated 1
the 1
operation 1
did 1
it 1
again 1
compared 1
the 1
insignificant 1
whitewashed 1
streak 1
with 1
the 1
far 1
reaching 1
continent 1
of 1
unwhitewashed 1
fence 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
tree 1
box 1
discouraged 1
Jim 1
came 1
skipping 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
with 1
a 1
tin 1
pail 1
and 1
singing 1
Buffalo 1
Gals 1
Bringing 1
water 1
from 1
the 1
town 1
pump 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
hateful 1
work 1
in 1
Tom 1
s 1
eyes 1
before 1
but 1
now 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
strike 1
him 1
so 1
He 1
remembered 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
company 1
at 1
the 1
pump 1
White 1
mulatto 1
and 1
negro 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
were 1
always 1
there 1
waiting 1
their 1
turns 1
resting 1
trading 1
playthings 1
quarrelling 1
fighting 1
skylarking 1
And 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
although 1
the 1
pump 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
yards 1
off 1
Jim 1
never 1
got 1
back 1
with 1
a 1
bucket 1
of 1
water 1
under 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
even 1
then 1
somebody 1
generally 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
after 1
him 1
Tom 1
said 1
Say 1
Jim 1
I 1
ll 1
fetch 1
the 1
water 1
if 1
you 1
ll 1
whitewash 1

Jim 1

his 1
head 1
and 1
said 1

to 1

White 1

And 1
besides 1
if 1
you 1

I 1
ll 1
show 1

my 1
sore 1
toe 1
Jim 1
was 1
only 1
human 1
this 1
attraction 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
him 1
He 1
put 1
down 1
his 1
pail 1
took 1
the 1
white 1
alley 1
and 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
toe 1
with 1
absorbing 1
interest 1
while 1
the 1
bandage 1
was 1
being 1
unwound 1
In 1
another 1
moment 1
he 1
was 1
flying 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
with 1
his 1
pail 1
and 1
a 1
tingling 1
rear 1
Tom 1
was 1
whitewashing 1
with 1
vigor 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
was 1
retiring 1
from 1
the 1
field 1
with 1
a 1
slipper 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
triumph 1
in 1
her 1
eye 1
But 1
Tom 1
s 1
energy 1
did 1
not 1
last 1
He 1
began 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
fun 1
he 1
had 1
planned 1
for 1
this 1
day 1
and 1
his 1
sorrows 1
multiplied 1
Soon 1
the 1
free 1
boys 1
would 1
come 1
tripping 1
along 1
on 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
delicious 1
expeditions 1
and 1
they 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
world 1
of 1
fun 1
of 1
him 1
for 1
having 1
to 1
work 1
the 1
very 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
burnt 1
him 1
like 1
fire 1
He 1
got 1
out 1
his 1
worldly 1
wealth 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
bits 1
of 1
toys 1
marbles 1
and 1
trash 1
enough 1
to 1
buy 1
an 1
exchange 1
of 1
work 1
maybe 1
but 1
not 1
half 1
enough 1
to 1
buy 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
of 1
pure 1
freedom 1
So 1
he 1
returned 1
his 1
straitened 1
means 1
to 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
buy 1
the 1
boys 1
At 1
this 1
dark 1
and 1
hopeless 1
moment 1
an 1
inspiration 1
burst 1
upon 1
him 1
Nothing 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
great 1
magnificent 1
inspiration 1
He 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
brush 1
and 1
went 1
tranquilly 1
to 1
work 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
hove 1
in 1
sight 1
presently 1
the 1
very 1
boy 1
of 1
all 1
boys 1
whose 1
ridicule 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
dreading 1
Ben 1
s 1
gait 1
was 1
the 1
hop 1
skip 1
and 1
jump 1
proof 1
enough 1
that 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
light 1
and 1
his 1
anticipations 1
high 1
He 1
was 1
eating 1
an 1
apple 1
and 1
giving 1
a 1
long 1
melodious 1
whoop 1
at 1
intervals 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
deep 1
toned 1
ding 1

for 1
he 1
was 1
personating 1
a 1
steamboat 1
As 1
he 1
drew 1
near 1
he 1
slackened 1
speed 1
took 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
leaned 1
far 1
over 1
to 1
starboard 1
and 1
rounded 1
to 1
ponderously 1
and 1
with 1
laborious 1
pomp 1
and 1
circumstance 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
personating 1
the 1
Big 1
Missouri 1
and 1
considered 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
drawing 1
nine 1
feet 1
of 1
water 1
He 1
was 1
boat 1
and 1
captain 1
and 1
engine 1
bells 1
combined 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
imagine 1
himself 1
standing 1
on 1
his 1
own 1
hurricane 1
deck 1
giving 1
the 1
orders 1

for 1
the 1
apple 1
but 1
he 1
stuck 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
Ben 1
said 1
Hello 1
old 1
chap 1

Tom 1
wheeled 1
suddenly 1
and 1
said 1

Course 1

Tom 1
contemplated 1
the 1
boy 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
said 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
call 1
work 1
Why 1
ain 1
t 1
that 1
work 1
Tom 1
resumed 1
his 1
whitewashing 1
and 1
answered 1
carelessly 1
Well 1
maybe 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
maybe 1
it 1

t 1
All 1
I 1
know 1
is 1
it 1
suits 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
Oh 1
come 1
now 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
mean 1
to 1
let 1
on 1
that 1
you 1
like 1
it 1
The 1
brush 1
continued 1
to 1
move 1
Like 1
it 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
why 1
I 1
oughtn 1
t 1
to 1
like 1
it 1
Does 1
a 1
boy 1
get 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
whitewash 1
a 1
fence 1
every 1
day 1
That 1
put 1
the 1
thing 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
light 1
Ben 1
stopped 1
nibbling 1
his 1
apple 1
Tom 1
swept 1
his 1
brush 1
daintily 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
stepped 1
back 1
to 1
note 1
the 1
effect 1
added 1
a 1
touch 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
criticised 1
the 1
effect 1
again 1
Ben 1
watching 1
every 1
move 1
and 1
getting 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
interested 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
absorbed 1
Presently 1
he 1
said 1
Say 1
Tom 1
let 1
me 1
whitewash 1
a 1
little 1
Tom 1
considered 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
consent 1
but 1
he 1
altered 1
his 1
mind 1
No 1
no 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
do 1
Ben 1
You 1
see 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
awful 1
particular 1
about 1
this 1
fence 1
right 1
here 1
on 1
the 1
street 1
you 1
know 1
but 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
back 1
fence 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
mind 1
and 1
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
Yes 1

awful 1
particular 1
about 1
this 1
fence 1
it 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
very 1
careful 1
I 1
reckon 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
one 1
boy 1
in 1
a 1
thousand 1
maybe 1
two 1
thousand 1
that 1
can 1
do 1
it 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
No 1
is 1
that 1
so 1
Oh 1

Only 1

injun 1
but 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1

Jim 1

but 1
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
let 1
him 1
Sid 1

to 1

it 1
and 1
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
let 1
Sid 1
Now 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
how 1
I 1
m 1
fixed 1
If 1
you 1
was 1
to 1
tackle 1
this 1
fence 1
and 1
anything 1
was 1
to 1
happen 1
to 1
it 1
Oh 1

Now 1

Say 1

t 1
I 1
m 1
afeard 1
I 1
ll 1
give 1
you 1
all 1
of 1
it 1
Tom 1
gave 1
up 1
the 1
brush 1
with 1
reluctance 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
but 1
alacrity 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
And 1
while 1
the 1
late 1
steamer 1
Big 1
Missouri 1
worked 1
and 1
sweated 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
the 1
retired 1
artist 1
sat 1
on 1
a 1
barrel 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
close 1
by 1
dangled 1
his 1
legs 1
munched 1
his 1
apple 1
and 1
planned 1
the 1
slaughter 1
of 1
more 1
innocents 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
lack 1
of 1
material 1
boys 1
happened 1
along 1
every 1
little 1
while 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
jeer 1
but 1
remained 1
to 1
whitewash 1
By 1
the 1
time 1
Ben 1
was 1
fagged 1
out 1
Tom 1
had 1
traded 1
the 1
next 1
chance 1
to 1
Billy 1
Fisher 1
for 1
a 1
kite 1
in 1
good 1
repair 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
played 1
out 1
Johnny 1
Miller 1
bought 1
in 1
for 1
a 1
dead 1
rat 1
and 1
a 1
string 1
to 1
swing 1
it 1
with 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
hour 1
after 1
hour 1
And 1
when 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
came 1
from 1
being 1
a 1
poor 1
poverty 1
stricken 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
Tom 1
was 1
literally 1
rolling 1
in 1
wealth 1
He 1
had 1
besides 1
the 1
things 1
before 1
mentioned 1
twelve 1
marbles 1
part 1
of 1
a 1
jews 1
harp 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
blue 1
bottle 1
glass 1
to 1
look 1
through 1
a 1
spool 1
cannon 1
a 1
key 1
that 1
wouldn 1
t 1
unlock 1
anything 1
a 1
fragment 1
of 1
chalk 1
a 1
glass 1
stopper 1
of 1
a 1
decanter 1
a 1
tin 1
soldier 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
tadpoles 1
six 1
fire 1
crackers 1
a 1
kitten 1
with 1
only 1
one 1
eye 1
a 1
brass 1
door 1
knob 1
a 1
dog 1
collar 1
but 1
no 1
dog 1
the 1
handle 1
of 1
a 1
knife 1
four 1
pieces 1
of 1
orange 1
peel 1
and 1
a 1
dilapidated 1
old 1
window 1
sash 1
He 1
had 1
had 1
a 1
nice 1
good 1
idle 1
time 1
all 1
the 1
while 1
plenty 1
of 1
company 1
and 1
the 1
fence 1
had 1
three 1
coats 1
of 1
whitewash 1
on 1
it 1
If 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
run 1
out 1
of 1
whitewash 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
bankrupted 1
every 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
Tom 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
hollow 1
world 1
after 1
all 1
He 1
had 1
discovered 1
a 1
great 1
law 1
of 1
human 1
action 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
namely 1
that 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
man 1
or 1
a 1
boy 1
covet 1
a 1
thing 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
necessary 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
thing 1
difficult 1
to 1
attain 1
If 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
wise 1
philosopher 1
like 1
the 1
writer 1
of 1
this 1
book 1
he 1
would 1
now 1
have 1
comprehended 1
that 1
Work 1
consists 1
of 1
whatever 1
a 1
body 1
is 1
obliged 1
to 1
do 1
and 1
that 1
Play 1
consists 1
of 1
whatever 1
a 1
body 1
is 1
not 1
obliged 1
to 1
do 1
And 1
this 1
would 1
help 1
him 1
to 1
understand 1
why 1
constructing 1
artificial 1
flowers 1
or 1
performing 1
on 1
a 1
tread 1
mill 1
is 1
work 1
while 1
rolling 1
ten 1
pins 1
or 1
climbing 1
Mont 1
Blanc 1
is 1
only 1
amusement 1
There 1
are 1
wealthy 1
gentlemen 1
in 1
England 1
who 1
drive 1
four 1
horse 1
passenger 1
coaches 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
miles 1
on 1
a 1
daily 1
line 1
in 1
the 1
summer 1
because 1
the 1
privilege 1
costs 1
them 1
considerable 1
money 1
but 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
offered 1
wages 1
for 1
the 1
service 1
that 1
would 1
turn 1
it 1
into 1
work 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
would 1
resign 1
The 1
boy 1
mused 1
awhile 1
over 1
the 1
substantial 1
change 1
which 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
his 1
worldly 1
circumstances 1
and 1
then 1
wended 1
toward 1
headquarters 1
to 1
report 1
CHAPTER 1
III 1
TOM 1
presented 1
himself 1
before 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
who 1
was 1
sitting 1
by 1
an 1
open 1
window 1
in 1
a 1
pleasant 1
rearward 1
apartment 1
which 1
was 1
bedroom 1
breakfast 1
room 1
dining 1
room 1
and 1
library 1
combined 1
The 1
balmy 1
summer 1
air 1
the 1
restful 1
quiet 1
the 1
odor 1
of 1
the 1
flowers 1
and 1
the 1
drowsing 1
murmur 1
of 1
the 1
bees 1
had 1
had 1
their 1
effect 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
nodding 1
over 1
her 1
knitting 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
company 1
but 1
the 1
cat 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
asleep 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
Her 1
spectacles 1
were 1
propped 1
up 1
on 1
her 1
gray 1
head 1
for 1
safety 1
She 1
had 1
thought 1
that 1
of 1
course 1
Tom 1
had 1
deserted 1
long 1
ago 1
and 1
she 1
wondered 1
at 1
seeing 1
him 1
place 1
himself 1
in 1
her 1
power 1
again 1
in 1
this 1
intrepid 1
way 1
He 1
said 1
Mayn 1
t 1
I 1
go 1
and 1
play 1
now 1
aunt 1
What 1
a 1
ready 1
How 1
much 1
have 1
you 1
done 1
It 1
s 1
all 1
done 1
aunt 1
Tom 1
don 1
t 1
lie 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
it 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
aunt 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
done 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
placed 1
small 1
trust 1
in 1
such 1
evidence 1
She 1
went 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
for 1
herself 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
content 1
to 1
find 1
twenty 1
per 1
cent 1
of 1
Tom 1
s 1
statement 1
true 1
When 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
entire 1
fence 1
white 1
washed 1
and 1
not 1
only 1
whitewashed 1
but 1
elaborately 1
coated 1
and 1
recoated 1
and 1
even 1
a 1
streak 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
her 1
astonishment 1
was 1
almost 1
unspeakable 1
She 1
said 1
Well 1
I 1
never 1
There 1
s 1
no 1
getting 1
round 1
it 1
you 1
can 1
work 1
when 1
you 1
re 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
Tom 1
And 1
then 1
she 1
diluted 1
the 1
compliment 1
by 1
adding 1
But 1
it 1
s 1
powerful 1
seldom 1
you 1
re 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
I 1
m 1
bound 1
to 1
say 1
Well 1
go 1
long 1
and 1
play 1
but 1
mind 1
you 1
get 1
back 1
some 1
time 1
in 1
a 1
week 1
or 1
I 1
ll 1
tan 1
you 1
She 1
was 1
so 1
overcome 1
by 1
the 1
splendor 1
of 1
his 1
achievement 1
that 1
she 1
took 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
closet 1
and 1
selected 1
a 1
choice 1
apple 1
and 1
delivered 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
along 1
with 1
an 1
improving 1
lecture 1
upon 1
the 1
added 1
value 1
and 1
flavor 1
a 1
treat 1
took 1
to 1
itself 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
without 1
sin 1
through 1
virtuous 1
effort 1
And 1
while 1
she 1
closed 1
with 1
a 1
happy 1
Scriptural 1
flourish 1
he 1
hooked 1
a 1
doughnut 1
Then 1
he 1
skipped 1
out 1
and 1
saw 1
Sid 1
just 1
starting 1
up 1
the 1
outside 1
stairway 1
that 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
back 1
rooms 1
on 1
the 1
second 1
floor 1
Clods 1
were 1
handy 1
and 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
twinkling 1
They 1
raged 1
around 1
Sid 1
like 1
a 1
hail 1
storm 1
and 1
before 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
could 1
collect 1
her 1
surprised 1
faculties 1
and 1
sally 1
to 1
the 1
rescue 1
six 1
or 1
seven 1
clods 1
had 1
taken 1
personal 1
effect 1
and 1
Tom 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
and 1
gone 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
gate 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
general 1
thing 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
crowded 1
for 1
time 1
to 1
make 1
use 1
of 1
it 1
His 1
soul 1
was 1
at 1
peace 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
settled 1
with 1
Sid 1
for 1
calling 1
attention 1
to 1
his 1
black 1
thread 1
and 1
getting 1
him 1
into 1
trouble 1
Tom 1
skirted 1
the 1
block 1
and 1
came 1
round 1
into 1
a 1
muddy 1
alley 1
that 1
led 1
by 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
cow 1
stable 1
He 1
presently 1
got 1
safely 1
beyond 1
the 1
reach 1
of 1
capture 1
and 1
punishment 1
and 1
hastened 1
toward 1
the 1
public 1
square 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
where 1
two 1
military 1
companies 1
of 1
boys 1
had 1
met 1
for 1
conflict 1
according 1
to 1
previous 1
appointment 1
Tom 1
was 1
General 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
armies 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
a 1
bosom 1
friend 1
General 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
These 1
two 1
great 1
commanders 1
did 1
not 1
condescend 1
to 1
fight 1
in 1
person 1
that 1
being 1
better 1
suited 1
to 1
the 1
still 1
smaller 1
fry 1
but 1
sat 1
together 1
on 1
an 1
eminence 1
and 1
conducted 1
the 1
field 1
operations 1
by 1
orders 1
delivered 1
through 1
aides 1
de 1
camp 1
Tom 1
s 1
army 1
won 1
a 1
great 1
victory 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
hard 1
fought 1
battle 1
Then 1
the 1
dead 1
were 1
counted 1
prisoners 1
exchanged 1
the 1
terms 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
disagreement 1
agreed 1
upon 1
and 1
the 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
necessary 1
battle 1
appointed 1
after 1
which 1
the 1
armies 1
fell 1
into 1
line 1
and 1
marched 1
away 1
and 1
Tom 1
turned 1
homeward 1
alone 1
As 1
he 1
was 1
passing 1
by 1
the 1
house 1
where 1
Jeff 1
Thatcher 1
lived 1
he 1
saw 1
a 1
new 1
girl 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
a 1
lovely 1
little 1
blue 1
eyed 1
creature 1
with 1
yellow 1
hair 1
plaited 1
into 1
two 1
long 1
tails 1
white 1
summer 1
frock 1
and 1
embroidered 1
pan 1
talettes 1
The 1
fresh 1
crowned 1
hero 1
fell 1
without 1
firing 1
a 1
shot 1
A 1
certain 1
Amy 1
Lawrence 1
vanished 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
left 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
memory 1
of 1
herself 1
behind 1
He 1
had 1
thought 1
he 1
loved 1
her 1
to 1
distraction 1
he 1
had 1
regarded 1
his 1
passion 1
as 1
adoration 1
and 1
behold 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
poor 1
little 1
evanescent 1
partiality 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
months 1
winning 1
her 1
she 1
had 1
confessed 1
hardly 1
a 1
week 1
ago 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
happiest 1
and 1
the 1
proudest 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
only 1
seven 1
short 1
days 1
and 1
here 1
in 1
one 1
instant 1
of 1
time 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
heart 1
like 1
a 1
casual 1
stranger 1
whose 1
visit 1
is 1
done 1
He 1
worshipped 1
this 1
new 1
angel 1
with 1
furtive 1
eye 1
till 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
discovered 1
him 1
then 1
he 1
pretended 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
she 1
was 1
present 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
show 1
off 1
in 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
absurd 1
boyish 1
ways 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
win 1
her 1
admiration 1
He 1
kept 1
up 1
this 1
grotesque 1
foolishness 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
but 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
some 1
dangerous 1
gymnastic 1
performances 1
he 1
glanced 1
aside 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
little 1
girl 1
was 1
wending 1
her 1
way 1
toward 1
the 1
house 1
Tom 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
fence 1
and 1
leaned 1
on 1
it 1
grieving 1
and 1
hoping 1
she 1
would 1
tarry 1
yet 1
awhile 1
longer 1
She 1
halted 1
a 1
moment 1
on 1
the 1
steps 1
and 1
then 1
moved 1
toward 1
the 1
door 1
Tom 1
heaved 1
a 1
great 1
sigh 1
as 1
she 1
put 1
her 1
foot 1
on 1
the 1
threshold 1
But 1
his 1
face 1
lit 1
up 1
right 1
away 1
for 1
she 1
tossed 1
a 1
pansy 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
a 1
moment 1
before 1
she 1
disappeared 1
The 1
boy 1
ran 1
around 1
and 1
stopped 1
within 1
a 1
foot 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
flower 1
and 1
then 1
shaded 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
look 1
down 1
street 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
discovered 1
something 1
of 1
interest 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
that 1
direction 1
Presently 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
straw 1
and 1
began 1
trying 1
to 1
balance 1
it 1
on 1
his 1
nose 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
tilted 1
far 1
back 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
moved 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side 1
in 1
his 1
efforts 1
he 1
edged 1
nearer 1
and 1
nearer 1
toward 1
the 1
pansy 1
finally 1
his 1
bare 1
foot 1
rested 1
upon 1
it 1
his 1
pliant 1
toes 1
closed 1
upon 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
hopped 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
treasure 1
and 1
disappeared 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
But 1
only 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
only 1
while 1
he 1
could 1
button 1
the 1
flower 1
inside 1
his 1
jacket 1
next 1
his 1
heart 1
or 1
next 1
his 1
stomach 1
possibly 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
much 1
posted 1
in 1
anatomy 1
and 1
not 1
hypercritical 1
anyway 1
He 1
returned 1
now 1
and 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
fence 1
till 1
nightfall 1
showing 1
off 1
as 1
before 1
but 1
the 1
girl 1
never 1
exhibited 1
herself 1
again 1
though 1
Tom 1
comforted 1
himself 1
a 1
little 1
with 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
near 1
some 1
window 1
meantime 1
and 1
been 1
aware 1
of 1
his 1
attentions 1
Finally 1
he 1
strode 1
home 1
reluctantly 1
with 1
his 1
poor 1
head 1
full 1
of 1
visions 1
All 1
through 1
supper 1
his 1
spirits 1
were 1
so 1
high 1
that 1
his 1
aunt 1
wondered 1
what 1
had 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
child 1
He 1
took 1
a 1
good 1
scolding 1
about 1
clodding 1
Sid 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
mind 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
He 1
tried 1
to 1
steal 1
sugar 1
under 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
very 1
nose 1
and 1
got 1
his 1
knuckles 1
rapped 1
for 1
it 1
He 1
said 1
Aunt 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
whack 1
Sid 1
when 1
he 1
takes 1
it 1
Well 1
Sid 1
don 1
t 1
torment 1
a 1
body 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
do 1
You 1
d 1
be 1
always 1
into 1
that 1
sugar 1
if 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
watching 1
you 1
Presently 1
she 1
stepped 1
into 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
Sid 1
happy 1
in 1
his 1
immunity 1
reached 1
for 1
the 1
sugar 1
bowl 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
glorying 1
over 1
Tom 1
which 1
was 1
wellnigh 1
unbearable 1
But 1
Sid 1
s 1
fingers 1
slipped 1
and 1
the 1
bowl 1
dropped 1
and 1
broke 1
Tom 1
was 1
in 1
ecstasies 1
In 1
such 1
ecstasies 1
that 1
he 1
even 1
controlled 1
his 1
tongue 1
and 1
was 1
silent 1
He 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
speak 1
a 1
word 1
even 1
when 1
his 1
aunt 1
came 1
in 1
but 1
would 1
sit 1
perfectly 1
still 1
till 1
she 1
asked 1
who 1
did 1
the 1
mischief 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
tell 1
and 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
nothing 1
so 1
good 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
pet 1
model 1
catch 1
it 1
He 1
was 1
so 1
brimful 1
of 1
exultation 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
hold 1
himself 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
came 1
back 1
and 1
stood 1
above 1
the 1
wreck 1
discharging 1
lightnings 1
of 1
wrath 1
from 1
over 1
her 1
spectacles 1
He 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
Now 1
it 1
s 1
coming 1
And 1
the 1
next 1
instant 1
he 1
was 1
sprawling 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
The 1
potent 1
palm 1
was 1
uplifted 1
to 1
strike 1
again 1
when 1
Tom 1
cried 1
out 1
Hold 1
on 1
now 1
what 1
er 1
you 1
belting 1
me 1
for 1
Sid 1
broke 1
it 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
paused 1
perplexed 1
and 1
Tom 1
looked 1
for 1
healing 1
pity 1
But 1
when 1
she 1
got 1
her 1
tongue 1
again 1
she 1
only 1
said 1
Umf 1
Well 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
get 1
a 1
lick 1
amiss 1
I 1
reckon 1
You 1
been 1
into 1
some 1
other 1
audacious 1
mischief 1
when 1
I 1
wasn 1
t 1
around 1
like 1
enough 1
Then 1
her 1
conscience 1
reproached 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
yearned 1
to 1
say 1
something 1
kind 1
and 1
loving 1
but 1
she 1
judged 1
that 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
construed 1
into 1
a 1
confession 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
and 1
discipline 1
forbade 1
that 1
So 1
she 1
kept 1
silence 1
and 1
went 1
about 1
her 1
affairs 1
with 1
a 1
troubled 1
heart 1
Tom 1
sulked 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
exalted 1
his 1
woes 1
He 1
knew 1
that 1
in 1
her 1
heart 1
his 1
aunt 1
was 1
on 1
her 1
knees 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
morosely 1
gratified 1
by 1
the 1
consciousness 1
of 1
it 1
He 1
would 1
hang 1
out 1
no 1
signals 1
he 1
would 1
take 1
notice 1
of 1
none 1
He 1
knew 1
that 1
a 1
yearning 1
glance 1
fell 1
upon 1
him 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
through 1
a 1
film 1
of 1
tears 1
but 1
he 1
refused 1
recognition 1
of 1
it 1
He 1
pictured 1
himself 1
lying 1
sick 1
unto 1
death 1
and 1
his 1
aunt 1
bending 1
over 1
him 1
beseeching 1
one 1
little 1
forgiving 1
word 1
but 1
he 1
would 1
turn 1
his 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
die 1
with 1
that 1
word 1
unsaid 1
Ah 1
how 1
would 1
she 1
feel 1
then 1
And 1
he 1
pictured 1
himself 1
brought 1
home 1
from 1
the 1
river 1
dead 1
with 1
his 1
curls 1
all 1
wet 1
and 1
his 1
sore 1
heart 1
at 1
rest 1
How 1
she 1
would 1
throw 1
herself 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
how 1
her 1
tears 1
would 1
fall 1
like 1
rain 1
and 1
her 1
lips 1
pray 1
God 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
back 1
her 1
boy 1
and 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
never 1
abuse 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
But 1
he 1
would 1
lie 1
there 1
cold 1
and 1
white 1
and 1
make 1
no 1
sign 1
a 1
poor 1
little 1
sufferer 1
whose 1
griefs 1
were 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
He 1
so 1
worked 1
upon 1
his 1
feelings 1
with 1
the 1
pathos 1
of 1
these 1
dreams 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
keep 1
swallowing 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
like 1
to 1
choke 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
swam 1
in 1
a 1
blur 1
of 1
water 1
which 1
overflowed 1
when 1
he 1
winked 1
and 1
ran 1
down 1
and 1
trickled 1
from 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
nose 1
And 1
such 1
a 1
luxury 1
to 1
him 1
was 1
this 1
petting 1
of 1
his 1
sorrows 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
have 1
any 1
worldly 1
cheeriness 1
or 1
any 1
grating 1
delight 1
intrude 1
upon 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
sacred 1
for 1
such 1
contact 1
and 1
so 1
presently 1
when 1
his 1
cousin 1
Mary 1
danced 1
in 1
all 1
alive 1
with 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
seeing 1
home 1
again 1
after 1
an 1
age 1
long 1
visit 1
of 1
one 1
week 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
moved 1
in 1
clouds 1
and 1
darkness 1
out 1
at 1
one 1
door 1
as 1
she 1
brought 1
song 1
and 1
sunshine 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
He 1
wandered 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
accustomed 1
haunts 1
of 1
boys 1
and 1
sought 1
desolate 1
places 1
that 1
were 1
in 1
harmony 1
with 1
his 1
spirit 1
A 1
log 1
raft 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
invited 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
seated 1
himself 1
on 1
its 1
outer 1
edge 1
and 1
contemplated 1
the 1
dreary 1
vastness 1
of 1
the 1
stream 1
wishing 1
the 1
while 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
be 1
drowned 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
unconsciously 1
without 1
undergoing 1
the 1
uncomfortable 1
routine 1
devised 1
by 1
nature 1
Then 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
his 1
flower 1
He 1
got 1
it 1
out 1
rumpled 1
and 1
wilted 1
and 1
it 1
mightily 1
increased 1
his 1
dismal 1
felicity 1
He 1
wondered 1
if 1
she 1
would 1
pity 1
him 1
if 1
she 1
knew 1
Would 1
she 1
cry 1
and 1
wish 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
put 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
comfort 1
him 1
Or 1
would 1
she 1
turn 1
coldly 1
away 1
like 1
all 1
the 1
hollow 1
world 1
This 1
picture 1
brought 1
such 1
an 1
agony 1
of 1
pleasurable 1
suffering 1
that 1
he 1
worked 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
new 1
and 1
varied 1
lights 1
till 1
he 1
wore 1
it 1
threadbare 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
rose 1
up 1
sighing 1
and 1
departed 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
About 1
half 1
past 1
nine 1
or 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
he 1
came 1
along 1
the 1
deserted 1
street 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
Adored 1
Unknown 1
lived 1
he 1
paused 1
a 1
moment 1
no 1
sound 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
listening 1
ear 1
a 1
candle 1
was 1
casting 1
a 1
dull 1
glow 1
upon 1
the 1
curtain 1
of 1
a 1
second 1
story 1
window 1
Was 1
the 1
sacred 1
presence 1
there 1
He 1
climbed 1
the 1
fence 1
threaded 1
his 1
stealthy 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
plants 1
till 1
he 1
stood 1
under 1
that 1
window 1
he 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
it 1
long 1
and 1
with 1
emotion 1
then 1
he 1
laid 1
him 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
under 1
it 1
disposing 1
himself 1
upon 1
his 1
back 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
clasped 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
holding 1
his 1
poor 1
wilted 1
flower 1
And 1
thus 1
he 1
would 1
die 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
world 1
with 1
no 1
shelter 1
over 1
his 1
homeless 1
head 1
no 1
friendly 1
hand 1
to 1
wipe 1
the 1
death 1
damps 1
from 1
his 1
brow 1
no 1
loving 1
face 1
to 1
bend 1
pityingly 1
over 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
great 1
agony 1
came 1
And 1
thus 1
she 1
would 1
see 1
him 1
when 1
she 1
looked 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
glad 1
morning 1
and 1
oh 1
would 1
she 1
drop 1
one 1
little 1
tear 1
upon 1
his 1
poor 1
lifeless 1
form 1
would 1
she 1
heave 1
one 1
little 1
sigh 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
bright 1
young 1
life 1
so 1
rudely 1
blighted 1
so 1
untimely 1
cut 1
down 1
The 1
window 1
went 1
up 1
a 1
maid 1
servant 1
s 1
discordant 1
voice 1
profaned 1
the 1
holy 1
calm 1
and 1
a 1
deluge 1
of 1
water 1
drenched 1
the 1
prone 1
martyr 1
s 1
remains 1
The 1
strangling 1
hero 1
sprang 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
relieving 1
snort 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
whiz 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
missile 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
mingled 1
with 1
the 1
murmur 1
of 1
a 1
curse 1
a 1
sound 1
as 1
of 1
shivering 1
glass 1
followed 1
and 1
a 1
small 1
vague 1
form 1
went 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
and 1
shot 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
Not 1
long 1
after 1
as 1
Tom 1
all 1
undressed 1
for 1
bed 1
was 1
surveying 1
his 1
drenched 1
garments 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
a 1
tallow 1
dip 1
Sid 1
woke 1
up 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
any 1
dim 1
idea 1
of 1
making 1
any 1
references 1
to 1
allusions 1
he 1
thought 1
better 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
peace 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
danger 1
in 1
Tom 1
s 1
eye 1
Tom 1
turned 1
in 1
without 1
the 1
added 1
vexation 1
of 1
prayers 1
and 1
Sid 1
made 1
mental 1
note 1
of 1
the 1
omission 1
CHAPTER 1
IV 1
THE 1
sun 1
rose 1
upon 1
a 1
tranquil 1
world 1
and 1
beamed 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
peaceful 1
village 1
like 1
a 1
benediction 1
Breakfast 1
over 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
had 1
family 1
worship 1
it 1
began 1
with 1
a 1
prayer 1
built 1
from 1
the 1
ground 1
up 1
of 1
solid 1
courses 1
of 1
Scriptural 1
quotations 1
welded 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
thin 1
mortar 1
of 1
originality 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
this 1
she 1
delivered 1
a 1
grim 1
chapter 1
of 1
the 1
Mosaic 1
Law 1
as 1
from 1
Sinai 1
Then 1
Tom 1
girded 1
up 1
his 1
loins 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
work 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
verses 1
Sid 1
had 1
learned 1
his 1
lesson 1
days 1
before 1
Tom 1
bent 1
all 1
his 1
energies 1
to 1
the 1
memorizing 1
of 1
five 1
verses 1
and 1
he 1
chose 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
Sermon 1
on 1
the 1
Mount 1
because 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
no 1
verses 1
that 1
were 1
shorter 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
Tom 1
had 1
a 1
vague 1
general 1
idea 1
of 1
his 1
lesson 1
but 1
no 1
more 1
for 1
his 1
mind 1
was 1
traversing 1
the 1
whole 1
field 1
of 1
human 1
thought 1
and 1
his 1
hands 1
were 1
busy 1
with 1
distracting 1
recreations 1
Mary 1
took 1
his 1
book 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
recite 1
and 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
fog 1
Blessed 1

You 1

Don 1

Tom 1

manage 1
it 1
and 1
if 1
you 1

I 1

give 1
you 1
something 1

There 1
now 1
that 1
s 1
a 1

boy 1
All 1

What 1

Mary 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1

Never 1
you 1

Tom 1
You 1

I 1
say 1
it 1

it 1

You 1
bet 1
you 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
Mary 1
All 1
right 1
I 1
ll 1
tackle 1
it 1
again 1
And 1
he 1
did 1
tackle 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
under 1
the 1
double 1
pressure 1
of 1
curiosity 1
and 1
prospective 1
gain 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
with 1
such 1
spirit 1
that 1
he 1
accomplished 1
a 1
shining 1
success 1
Mary 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
brand 1
new 1
Barlow 1
knife 1
worth 1
twelve 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
cents 1
and 1
the 1
convulsion 1
of 1
delight 1
that 1
swept 1
his 1
system 1
shook 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
foundations 1
True 1
the 1
knife 1
would 1
not 1
cut 1
anything 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sure 1
enough 1
Barlow 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
inconceivable 1
grandeur 1
in 1
that 1
though 1
where 1
the 1
Western 1
boys 1
ever 1
got 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
weapon 1
could 1
possibly 1
be 1
counterfeited 1
to 1
its 1
injury 1
is 1
an 1
imposing 1
mystery 1
and 1
will 1
always 1
remain 1
so 1
perhaps 1
Tom 1
contrived 1
to 1
scarify 1
the 1
cupboard 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
arranging 1
to 1
begin 1
on 1
the 1
bureau 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
called 1
off 1
to 1
dress 1
for 1
Sunday 1
school 1
Mary 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
tin 1
basin 1
of 1
water 1
and 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
soap 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
outside 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
set 1
the 1
basin 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
bench 1
there 1
then 1
he 1
dipped 1
the 1
soap 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
laid 1
it 1
down 1
turned 1
up 1
his 1
sleeves 1
poured 1
out 1
the 1
water 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
gently 1
and 1
then 1
entered 1
the 1
kitchen 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
wipe 1
his 1
face 1
diligently 1
on 1
the 1
towel 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
But 1
Mary 1
removed 1
the 1
towel 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
ain 1
t 1
you 1
ashamed 1
Tom 1
You 1
mustn 1
t 1
be 1
so 1
bad 1
Water 1
won 1
t 1
hurt 1
you 1
Tom 1
was 1
a 1
trifle 1
disconcerted 1
The 1
basin 1
was 1
refilled 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
stood 1
over 1
it 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
gathering 1
resolution 1
took 1
in 1
a 1
big 1
breath 1
and 1
began 1
When 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
kitchen 1
presently 1
with 1
both 1
eyes 1
shut 1
and 1
groping 1
for 1
the 1
towel 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
an 1
honorable 1
testimony 1
of 1
suds 1
and 1
water 1
was 1
dripping 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
towel 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
satisfactory 1
for 1
the 1
clean 1
territory 1
stopped 1
short 1
at 1
his 1
chin 1
and 1
his 1
jaws 1
like 1
a 1
mask 1
below 1
and 1
beyond 1
this 1
line 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dark 1
expanse 1
of 1
unirrigated 1
soil 1
that 1
spread 1
downward 1
in 1
front 1
and 1
backward 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
Mary 1
took 1
him 1
in 1
hand 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
done 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
brother 1
without 1
distinction 1
of 1
color 1
and 1
his 1
saturated 1
hair 1
was 1
neatly 1
brushed 1
and 1
its 1
short 1
curls 1
wrought 1
into 1
a 1
dainty 1
and 1
symmetrical 1
general 1
effect 1
He 1
privately 1
smoothed 1
out 1
the 1
curls 1
with 1
labor 1
and 1
difficulty 1
and 1
plastered 1
his 1
hair 1
close 1
down 1
to 1
his 1
head 1
for 1
he 1
held 1
curls 1
to 1
be 1
effeminate 1
and 1
his 1
own 1
filled 1
his 1
life 1
with 1
bitterness 1
Then 1
Mary 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
suit 1
of 1
his 1
clothing 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
used 1
only 1
on 1
Sundays 1
during 1
two 1
years 1
they 1
were 1
simply 1
called 1
his 1
other 1
clothes 1
and 1
so 1
by 1
that 1
we 1
know 1
the 1
size 1
of 1
his 1
wardrobe 1
The 1
girl 1
put 1
him 1
to 1
rights 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
dressed 1
himself 1
she 1
buttoned 1
his 1
neat 1
roundabout 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
chin 1
turned 1
his 1
vast 1
shirt 1
collar 1
down 1
over 1
his 1
shoulders 1
brushed 1
him 1
off 1
and 1
crowned 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
speckled 1
straw 1
hat 1
He 1
now 1
looked 1
exceedingly 1
improved 1
and 1
uncomfortable 1
He 1
was 1
fully 1
as 1
uncomfortable 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
restraint 1
about 1
whole 1
clothes 1
and 1
cleanliness 1
that 1
galled 1
him 1
He 1
hoped 1
that 1
Mary 1
would 1
forget 1
his 1
shoes 1
but 1
the 1
hope 1
was 1
blighted 1
she 1
coated 1
them 1
thoroughly 1
with 1
tallow 1
as 1
was 1
the 1
custom 1
and 1
brought 1
them 1
out 1
He 1
lost 1
his 1
temper 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
being 1
made 1
to 1
do 1
everything 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
But 1
Mary 1
said 1
persuasively 1
Please 1
Tom 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
So 1
he 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
shoes 1
snarling 1
Mary 1
was 1
soon 1
ready 1
and 1
the 1
three 1
children 1
set 1
out 1
for 1
Sunday 1
school 1
a 1
place 1
that 1
Tom 1
hated 1
with 1
his 1
whole 1
heart 1
but 1
Sid 1
and 1
Mary 1
were 1
fond 1
of 1
it 1
Sabbath 1
school 1
hours 1
were 1
from 1
nine 1
to 1
half 1
past 1
ten 1
and 1
then 1
church 1
service 1
Two 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
always 1
remained 1
for 1
the 1
sermon 1
voluntarily 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
always 1
remained 1
too 1
for 1
stronger 1
reasons 1
The 1
church 1
s 1
high 1
backed 1
uncushioned 1
pews 1
would 1
seat 1
about 1
three 1
hundred 1
persons 1
the 1
edifice 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
plain 1
affair 1
with 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
pine 1
board 1
tree 1
box 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
steeple 1
At 1
the 1
door 1
Tom 1
dropped 1
back 1
a 1
step 1
and 1
accosted 1
a 1
Sunday 1
dressed 1
comrade 1
Say 1
Billy 1
got 1
a 1
yaller 1
ticket 1
Yes 1
What 1
ll 1
you 1
take 1
for 1
her 1
What 1
ll 1
you 1
give 1
Piece 1
of 1
lickrish 1
and 1
a 1
fish 1
hook 1
Less 1
see 1
em 1
Tom 1
exhibited 1
They 1
were 1
satisfactory 1
and 1
the 1
property 1
changed 1
hands 1
Then 1
Tom 1
traded 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
white 1
alleys 1
for 1
three 1
red 1
tickets 1
and 1
some 1
small 1
trifle 1
or 1
other 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
blue 1
ones 1
He 1
waylaid 1
other 1
boys 1
as 1
they 1
came 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
buying 1
tickets 1
of 1
various 1
colors 1
ten 1
or 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
longer 1
He 1
entered 1
the 1
church 1
now 1
with 1
a 1
swarm 1
of 1
clean 1
and 1
noisy 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
proceeded 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
and 1
started 1
a 1
quarrel 1
with 1
the 1
first 1
boy 1
that 1
came 1
handy 1
The 1
teacher 1
a 1
grave 1
elderly 1
man 1
interfered 1
then 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
Tom 1
pulled 1
a 1
boy 1
s 1
hair 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
bench 1
and 1
was 1
absorbed 1
in 1
his 1
book 1
when 1
the 1
boy 1
turned 1
around 1
stuck 1
a 1
pin 1
in 1
another 1
boy 1
presently 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
say 1
Ouch 1
and 1
got 1
a 1
new 1
reprimand 1
from 1
his 1
teacher 1
Tom 1
s 1
whole 1
class 1
were 1
of 1
a 1
pattern 1
restless 1
noisy 1
and 1
troublesome 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
recite 1
their 1
lessons 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
knew 1
his 1
verses 1
perfectly 1
but 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
prompted 1
all 1
along 1
However 1
they 1
worried 1
through 1
and 1
each 1
got 1
his 1
reward 1
in 1
small 1
blue 1
tickets 1
each 1
with 1
a 1
passage 1
of 1
Scripture 1
on 1
it 1
each 1
blue 1
ticket 1
was 1
pay 1
for 1
two 1
verses 1
of 1
the 1
recitation 1
Ten 1
blue 1
tickets 1
equalled 1
a 1
red 1
one 1
and 1
could 1
be 1
exchanged 1
for 1
it 1
ten 1
red 1
tickets 1
equalled 1
a 1
yellow 1
one 1
for 1
ten 1
yellow 1
tickets 1
the 1
superintendent 1
gave 1
a 1
very 1
plainly 1
bound 1
Bible 1
worth 1
forty 1
cents 1
in 1
those 1
easy 1
times 1
to 1
the 1
pupil 1
How 1
many 1
of 1
my 1
readers 1
would 1
have 1
the 1
industry 1
and 1
application 1
to 1
memorize 1
two 1
thousand 1
verses 1
even 1
for 1
a 1
Dore 1
Bible 1
And 1
yet 1
Mary 1
had 1
acquired 1
two 1
Bibles 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
patient 1
work 1
of 1
two 1
years 1
and 1
a 1
boy 1
of 1
German 1
parentage 1
had 1
won 1
four 1
or 1
five 1
He 1
once 1
recited 1
three 1
thousand 1
verses 1
without 1
stopping 1
but 1
the 1
strain 1
upon 1
his 1
mental 1
faculties 1
was 1
too 1
great 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
little 1
better 1
than 1
an 1
idiot 1
from 1
that 1
day 1
forth 1
a 1
grievous 1
misfortune 1
for 1
the 1
school 1
for 1
on 1
great 1
occasions 1
before 1
company 1
the 1
superintendent 1
as 1
Tom 1
expressed 1
it 1
had 1
always 1
made 1
this 1
boy 1
come 1
out 1
and 1
spread 1
himself 1
Only 1
the 1
older 1
pupils 1
managed 1
to 1
keep 1
their 1
tickets 1
and 1
stick 1
to 1
their 1
tedious 1
work 1
long 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
Bible 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
delivery 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
prizes 1
was 1
a 1
rare 1
and 1
noteworthy 1
circumstance 1
the 1
successful 1
pupil 1
was 1
so 1
great 1
and 1
conspicuous 1
for 1
that 1
day 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
spot 1
every 1
scholar 1
s 1
heart 1
was 1
fired 1
with 1
a 1
fresh 1
ambition 1
that 1
often 1
lasted 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
weeks 1
It 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
Tom 1
s 1
mental 1
stomach 1
had 1
never 1
really 1
hungered 1
for 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
prizes 1
but 1
unquestionably 1
his 1
entire 1
being 1
had 1
for 1
many 1
a 1
day 1
longed 1
for 1
the 1
glory 1
and 1
the 1
eclat 1
that 1
came 1
with 1
it 1
In 1
due 1
course 1
the 1
superintendent 1
stood 1
up 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
pulpit 1
with 1
a 1
closed 1
hymn 1
book 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
his 1
forefinger 1
inserted 1
between 1
its 1
leaves 1
and 1
commanded 1
attention 1
When 1
a 1
Sunday 1
school 1
superintendent 1
makes 1
his 1
customary 1
little 1
speech 1
a 1
hymn 1
book 1
in 1
the 1
hand 1
is 1
as 1
necessary 1
as 1
is 1
the 1
inevitable 1
sheet 1
of 1
music 1
in 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
a 1
singer 1
who 1
stands 1
forward 1
on 1
the 1
platform 1
and 1
sings 1
a 1
solo 1
at 1
a 1
concert 1
though 1
why 1
is 1
a 1
mystery 1
for 1
neither 1
the 1
hymn 1
book 1
nor 1
the 1
sheet 1
of 1
music 1
is 1
ever 1
referred 1
to 1
by 1
the 1
sufferer 1
This 1
superintendent 1
was 1
a 1
slim 1
creature 1
of 1
thirty 1
five 1
with 1
a 1
sandy 1
goatee 1
and 1
short 1
sandy 1
hair 1
he 1
wore 1
a 1
stiff 1
standing 1
collar 1
whose 1
upper 1
edge 1
almost 1
reached 1
his 1
ears 1
and 1
whose 1
sharp 1
points 1
curved 1
forward 1
abreast 1
the 1
corners 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
a 1
fence 1
that 1
compelled 1
a 1
straight 1
lookout 1
ahead 1
and 1
a 1
turning 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
body 1
when 1
a 1
side 1
view 1
was 1
required 1
his 1
chin 1
was 1
propped 1
on 1
a 1
spreading 1
cravat 1
which 1
was 1
as 1
broad 1
and 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
a 1
bank 1
note 1
and 1
had 1
fringed 1
ends 1
his 1
boot 1
toes 1
were 1
turned 1
sharply 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
fashion 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
like 1
sleigh 1
runners 1
an 1
effect 1
patiently 1
and 1
laboriously 1
produced 1
by 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
by 1
sitting 1
with 1
their 1
toes 1
pressed 1
against 1
a 1
wall 1
for 1
hours 1
together 1
Mr 1
Walters 1
was 1
very 1
earnest 1
of 1
mien 1
and 1
very 1
sincere 1
and 1
honest 1
at 1
heart 1
and 1
he 1
held 1
sacred 1
things 1
and 1
places 1
in 1
such 1
reverence 1
and 1
so 1
separated 1
them 1
from 1
worldly 1
matters 1
that 1
unconsciously 1
to 1
himself 1
his 1
Sunday 1
school 1
voice 1
had 1
acquired 1
a 1
peculiar 1
intonation 1
which 1
was 1
wholly 1
absent 1
on 1
week 1
days 1
He 1
began 1
after 1
this 1
fashion 1
Now 1
children 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
all 1
to 1
sit 1
up 1
just 1
as 1
straight 1
and 1
pretty 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
all 1
your 1
attention 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
There 1
that 1
is 1
it 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
way 1
good 1
little 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
should 1
do 1
I 1
see 1
one 1
little 1
girl 1
who 1
is 1
looking 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
she 1
thinks 1
I 1
am 1
out 1
there 1
somewhere 1
perhaps 1
up 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
making 1
a 1
speech 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
birds 1
Applausive 1
titter 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
how 1
good 1
it 1
makes 1
me 1
feel 1
to 1
see 1
so 1
many 1
bright 1
clean 1
little 1
faces 1
assembled 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
like 1
this 1
learning 1
to 1
do 1
right 1
and 1
be 1
good 1
And 1
so 1
forth 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
It 1
is 1
not 1
necessary 1
to 1
set 1
down 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
oration 1
It 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
pattern 1
which 1
does 1
not 1
vary 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
familiar 1
to 1
us 1
all 1
The 1
latter 1
third 1
of 1
the 1
speech 1
was 1
marred 1
by 1
the 1
resumption 1
of 1
fights 1
and 1
other 1
recreations 1
among 1
certain 1
of 1
the 1
bad 1
boys 1
and 1
by 1
fidgetings 1
and 1
whisperings 1
that 1
extended 1
far 1
and 1
wide 1
washing 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
bases 1
of 1
isolated 1
and 1
incorruptible 1
rocks 1
like 1
Sid 1
and 1
Mary 1
But 1
now 1
every 1
sound 1
ceased 1
suddenly 1
with 1
the 1
subsidence 1
of 1
Mr 1
Walters 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
conclusion 1
of 1
the 1
speech 1
was 1
received 1
with 1
a 1
burst 1
of 1
silent 1
gratitude 1
A 1
good 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
whispering 1
had 1
been 1
occasioned 1
by 1
an 1
event 1
which 1
was 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
rare 1
the 1
entrance 1
of 1
visitors 1
lawyer 1
Thatcher 1
accompanied 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
feeble 1
and 1
aged 1
man 1
a 1
fine 1
portly 1
middle 1
aged 1
gentleman 1
with 1
iron 1
gray 1
hair 1
and 1
a 1
dignified 1
lady 1
who 1
was 1
doubtless 1
the 1
latter 1
s 1
wife 1
The 1
lady 1
was 1
leading 1
a 1
child 1
Tom 1
had 1
been 1
restless 1
and 1
full 1
of 1
chafings 1
and 1
repinings 1
conscience 1
smitten 1
too 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
meet 1
Amy 1
Lawrence 1
s 1
eye 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
brook 1
her 1
loving 1
gaze 1
But 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
this 1
small 1
newcomer 1
his 1
soul 1
was 1
all 1
ablaze 1
with 1
bliss 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
The 1
next 1
moment 1
he 1
was 1
showing 1
off 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
might 1
cuffing 1
boys 1
pulling 1
hair 1
making 1
faces 1
in 1
a 1
word 1
using 1
every 1
art 1
that 1
seemed 1
likely 1
to 1
fascinate 1
a 1
girl 1
and 1
win 1
her 1
applause 1
His 1
exaltation 1
had 1
but 1
one 1
alloy 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
his 1
humiliation 1
in 1
this 1
angel 1
s 1
garden 1
and 1
that 1
record 1
in 1
sand 1
was 1
fast 1
washing 1
out 1
under 1
the 1
waves 1
of 1
happiness 1
that 1
were 1
sweeping 1
over 1
it 1
now 1
The 1
visitors 1
were 1
given 1
the 1
highest 1
seat 1
of 1
honor 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
Mr 1
Walters 1
speech 1
was 1
finished 1
he 1
introduced 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
school 1
The 1
middle 1
aged 1
man 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
prodigious 1
personage 1
no 1
less 1
a 1
one 1
than 1
the 1
county 1
judge 1
altogether 1
the 1
most 1
august 1
creation 1
these 1
children 1
had 1
ever 1
looked 1
upon 1
and 1
they 1
wondered 1
what 1
kind 1
of 1
material 1
he 1
was 1
made 1
of 1
and 1
they 1
half 1
wanted 1
to 1
hear 1
him 1
roar 1
and 1
were 1
half 1
afraid 1
he 1
might 1
too 1
He 1
was 1
from 1
Constantinople 1
twelve 1
miles 1
away 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
travelled 1
and 1
seen 1
the 1
world 1
these 1
very 1
eyes 1
had 1
looked 1
upon 1
the 1
county 1
court 1
house 1
which 1
was 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
tin 1
roof 1
The 1
awe 1
which 1
these 1
reflections 1
inspired 1
was 1
attested 1
by 1
the 1
impressive 1
silence 1
and 1
the 1
ranks 1
of 1
staring 1
eyes 1
This 1
was 1
the 1
great 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
brother 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
lawyer 1
Jeff 1
Thatcher 1
immediately 1
went 1
forward 1
to 1
be 1
familiar 1
with 1
the 1
great 1
man 1
and 1
be 1
envied 1
by 1
the 1
school 1
It 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
music 1
to 1
his 1
soul 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
whisperings 1
Look 1
at 1
him 1
Jim 1
He 1
s 1
a 1
going 1
up 1
there 1
Say 1
look 1
he 1
s 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
shake 1
hands 1
with 1
him 1
he 1
is 1
shaking 1
hands 1
with 1
him 1
By 1
jings 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
wish 1
you 1
was 1
Jeff 1
Mr 1
Walters 1
fell 1
to 1
showing 1
off 1
with 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
official 1
bustlings 1
and 1
activities 1
giving 1
orders 1
delivering 1
judgments 1
discharging 1
directions 1
here 1
there 1
everywhere 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
a 1
target 1
The 1
librarian 1
showed 1
off 1
running 1
hither 1
and 1
thither 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
full 1
of 1
books 1
and 1
making 1
a 1
deal 1
of 1
the 1
splutter 1
and 1
fuss 1
that 1
insect 1
authority 1
delights 1
in 1
The 1
young 1
lady 1
teachers 1
showed 1
off 1
bending 1
sweetly 1
over 1
pupils 1
that 1
were 1
lately 1
being 1
boxed 1
lifting 1
pretty 1
warning 1
fingers 1
at 1
bad 1
little 1
boys 1
and 1
patting 1
good 1
ones 1
lovingly 1
The 1
young 1
gentlemen 1
teachers 1
showed 1
off 1
with 1
small 1
scoldings 1
and 1
other 1
little 1
displays 1
of 1
authority 1
and 1
fine 1
attention 1
to 1
discipline 1
and 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
teachers 1
of 1
both 1
sexes 1
found 1
business 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
library 1
by 1
the 1
pulpit 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
business 1
that 1
frequently 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
over 1
again 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
with 1
much 1
seeming 1
vexation 1
The 1
little 1
girls 1
showed 1
off 1
in 1
various 1
ways 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
boys 1
showed 1
off 1
with 1
such 1
diligence 1
that 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
thick 1
with 1
paper 1
wads 1
and 1
the 1
murmur 1
of 1
scufflings 1
And 1
above 1
it 1
all 1
the 1
great 1
man 1
sat 1
and 1
beamed 1
a 1
majestic 1
judicial 1
smile 1
upon 1
all 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
warmed 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
grandeur 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
showing 1
off 1
too 1
There 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
wanting 1
to 1
make 1
Mr 1
Walters 1
ecstasy 1
complete 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
deliver 1
a 1
Bible 1
prize 1
and 1
exhibit 1
a 1
prodigy 1
Several 1
pupils 1
had 1
a 1
few 1
yellow 1
tickets 1
but 1
none 1
had 1
enough 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
around 1
among 1
the 1
star 1
pupils 1
inquiring 1
He 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
worlds 1
now 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
German 1
lad 1
back 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
sound 1
mind 1
And 1
now 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
when 1
hope 1
was 1
dead 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
came 1
forward 1
with 1
nine 1
yellow 1
tickets 1
nine 1
red 1
tickets 1
and 1
ten 1
blue 1
ones 1
and 1
demanded 1
a 1
Bible 1
This 1
was 1
a 1
thunderbolt 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
clear 1
sky 1
Walters 1
was 1
not 1
expecting 1
an 1
application 1
from 1
this 1
source 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
ten 1
years 1
But 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
getting 1
around 1
it 1
here 1
were 1
the 1
certified 1
checks 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
good 1
for 1
their 1
face 1
Tom 1
was 1
therefore 1
elevated 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
with 1
the 1
Judge 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
elect 1
and 1
the 1
great 1
news 1
was 1
announced 1
from 1
headquarters 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
most 1
stunning 1
surprise 1
of 1
the 1
decade 1
and 1
so 1
profound 1
was 1
the 1
sensation 1
that 1
it 1
lifted 1
the 1
new 1
hero 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
judicial 1
one 1
s 1
altitude 1
and 1
the 1
school 1
had 1
two 1
marvels 1
to 1
gaze 1
upon 1
in 1
place 1
of 1
one 1
The 1
boys 1
were 1
all 1
eaten 1
up 1
with 1
envy 1
but 1
those 1
that 1
suffered 1
the 1
bitterest 1
pangs 1
were 1
those 1
who 1
perceived 1
too 1
late 1
that 1
they 1
themselves 1
had 1
contributed 1
to 1
this 1
hated 1
splendor 1
by 1
trading 1
tickets 1
to 1
Tom 1
for 1
the 1
wealth 1
he 1
had 1
amassed 1
in 1
selling 1
whitewashing 1
privileges 1
These 1
despised 1
themselves 1
as 1
being 1
the 1
dupes 1
of 1
a 1
wily 1
fraud 1
a 1
guileful 1
snake 1
in 1
the 1
grass 1
The 1
prize 1
was 1
delivered 1
to 1
Tom 1
with 1
as 1
much 1
effusion 1
as 1
the 1
superintendent 1
could 1
pump 1
up 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
but 1
it 1
lacked 1
somewhat 1
of 1
the 1
true 1
gush 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
s 1
instinct 1
taught 1
him 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
mystery 1
here 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
well 1
bear 1
the 1
light 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
simply 1
preposterous 1
that 1
this 1
boy 1
had 1
warehoused 1
two 1
thousand 1
sheaves 1
of 1
Scriptural 1
wisdom 1
on 1
his 1
premises 1
a 1
dozen 1
would 1
strain 1
his 1
capacity 1
without 1
a 1
doubt 1
Amy 1
Lawrence 1
was 1
proud 1
and 1
glad 1
and 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
Tom 1
see 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
but 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
look 1
She 1
wondered 1
then 1
she 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
grain 1
troubled 1
next 1
a 1
dim 1
suspicion 1
came 1
and 1
went 1
came 1
again 1
she 1
watched 1
a 1
furtive 1
glance 1
told 1
her 1
worlds 1
and 1
then 1
her 1
heart 1
broke 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
jealous 1
and 1
angry 1
and 1
the 1
tears 1
came 1
and 1
she 1
hated 1
everybody 1
Tom 1
most 1
of 1
all 1
she 1
thought 1
Tom 1
was 1
introduced 1
to 1
the 1
Judge 1
but 1
his 1
tongue 1
was 1
tied 1
his 1
breath 1
would 1
hardly 1
come 1
his 1
heart 1
quaked 1
partly 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
awful 1
greatness 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
but 1
mainly 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
her 1
parent 1
He 1
would 1
have 1
liked 1
to 1
fall 1
down 1
and 1
worship 1
him 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
The 1
Judge 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
Tom 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
called 1
him 1
a 1
fine 1
little 1
man 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
The 1
boy 1
stammered 1
gasped 1
and 1
got 1
it 1
out 1
Tom 1
Oh 1
no 1
not 1
Tom 1
it 1
is 1
Thomas 1
Ah 1
that 1
s 1
it 1
I 1
thought 1
there 1
was 1
more 1
to 1
it 1
maybe 1
That 1

very 1
well 1
But 1
you 1

and 1

tell 1
it 1
to 1
me 1

Tell 1

gentleman 1

Walters 1

You 1

your 1
manners 1

Two 1

then 1

It 1

CHAPTER 1
V 1
ABOUT 1
half 1
past 1
ten 1
the 1
cracked 1
bell 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
church 1
began 1
to 1
ring 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
people 1
began 1
to 1
gather 1
for 1
the 1
morning 1
sermon 1
The 1
Sunday 1
school 1
children 1
distributed 1
themselves 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
occupied 1
pews 1
with 1
their 1
parents 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
under 1
supervision 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
came 1
and 1
Tom 1
and 1
Sid 1
and 1
Mary 1
sat 1
with 1
her 1
Tom 1
being 1
placed 1
next 1
the 1
aisle 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
as 1
far 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
and 1
the 1
seductive 1
outside 1
summer 1
scenes 1
as 1
possible 1
The 1
crowd 1
filed 1
up 1
the 1
aisles 1
the 1
aged 1
and 1
needy 1
postmaster 1
who 1
had 1
seen 1
better 1
days 1
the 1
mayor 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
mayor 1
there 1
among 1
other 1
unnecessaries 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
the 1
peace 1
the 1
widow 1
Douglass 1
fair 1
smart 1
and 1
forty 1
a 1
generous 1
good 1
hearted 1
soul 1
and 1
well 1
to 1
do 1
her 1
hill 1
mansion 1
the 1
only 1
palace 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
hospitable 1
and 1
much 1
the 1
most 1
lavish 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
festivities 1
that 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
could 1
boast 1
the 1
bent 1
and 1
venerable 1
Major 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Ward 1
lawyer 1
Riverson 1
the 1
new 1
notable 1
from 1
a 1
distance 1
next 1
the 1
belle 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
troop 1
of 1
lawn 1
clad 1
and 1
ribbon 1
decked 1
young 1
heart 1
breakers 1
then 1
all 1
the 1
young 1
clerks 1
in 1
town 1
in 1
a 1
body 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
vestibule 1
sucking 1
their 1
cane 1
heads 1
a 1
circling 1
wall 1
of 1
oiled 1
and 1
simpering 1
admirers 1
till 1
the 1
last 1
girl 1
had 1
run 1
their 1
gantlet 1
and 1
last 1
of 1
all 1
came 1
the 1
Model 1
Boy 1
Willie 1
Mufferson 1
taking 1
as 1
heedful 1
care 1
of 1
his 1
mother 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
cut 1
glass 1
He 1
always 1
brought 1
his 1
mother 1
to 1
church 1
and 1
was 1
the 1
pride 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
matrons 1
The 1
boys 1
all 1
hated 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
good 1
And 1
besides 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
thrown 1
up 1
to 1
them 1
so 1
much 1
His 1
white 1
handkerchief 1
was 1
hanging 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
behind 1
as 1
usual 1
on 1
Sundays 1
accidentally 1
Tom 1
had 1
no 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
upon 1
boys 1
who 1
had 1
as 1
snobs 1
The 1
congregation 1
being 1
fully 1
assembled 1
now 1
the 1
bell 1
rang 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
warn 1
laggards 1
and 1
stragglers 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
solemn 1
hush 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
church 1
which 1
was 1
only 1
broken 1
by 1
the 1
tittering 1
and 1
whispering 1
of 1
the 1
choir 1
in 1
the 1
gallery 1
The 1
choir 1
always 1
tittered 1
and 1
whispered 1
all 1
through 1
service 1
There 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
church 1
choir 1
that 1
was 1
not 1
ill 1
bred 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
forgotten 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
I 1
can 1
scarcely 1
remember 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
some 1
foreign 1
country 1
The 1
minister 1
gave 1
out 1
the 1
hymn 1
and 1
read 1
it 1
through 1
with 1
a 1
relish 1
in 1
a 1
peculiar 1
style 1
which 1
was 1
much 1
admired 1
in 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
His 1
voice 1
began 1
on 1
a 1
medium 1
key 1
and 1
climbed 1
steadily 1
up 1
till 1
it 1
reached 1
a 1
certain 1
point 1
where 1
it 1
bore 1
with 1
strong 1
emphasis 1
upon 1
the 1
topmost 1
word 1
and 1
then 1
plunged 1
down 1
as 1
if 1
from 1
a 1
spring 1
board 1
Shall 1
I 1
be 1
car 1
ri 1
ed 1
toe 1
the 1
skies 1
on 1
flow 1
ry 1
beds 1
of 1
ease 1
Whilst 1
others 1
fight 1
to 1
win 1
the 1
prize 1
and 1
sail 1
thro 1
blood 1
y 1
seas 1
He 1
was 1
regarded 1
as 1
a 1
wonderful 1
reader 1
At 1
church 1
sociables 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
called 1
upon 1
to 1
read 1
poetry 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
through 1
the 1
ladies 1
would 1
lift 1
up 1
their 1
hands 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
fall 1
helplessly 1
in 1
their 1
laps 1
and 1
wall 1
their 1
eyes 1
and 1
shake 1
their 1
heads 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
to 1
say 1
Words 1
cannot 1
express 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
beautiful 1
TOO 1
beautiful 1
for 1
this 1
mortal 1
earth 1
After 1
the 1
hymn 1
had 1
been 1
sung 1
the 1
Rev 1
Mr 1
Sprague 1
turned 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
bulletin 1
board 1
and 1
read 1
off 1
notices 1
of 1
meetings 1
and 1
societies 1
and 1
things 1
till 1
it 1
seemed 1
that 1
the 1
list 1
would 1
stretch 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
crack 1
of 1
doom 1
a 1
queer 1
custom 1
which 1
is 1
still 1
kept 1
up 1
in 1
America 1
even 1
in 1
cities 1
away 1
here 1
in 1
this 1
age 1
of 1
abundant 1
newspapers 1
Often 1
the 1
less 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
justify 1
a 1
traditional 1
custom 1
the 1
harder 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
minister 1
prayed 1
A 1
good 1
generous 1
prayer 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
went 1
into 1
details 1
it 1
pleaded 1
for 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
the 1
little 1
children 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
for 1
the 1
other 1
churches 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
for 1
the 1
village 1
itself 1
for 1
the 1
county 1
for 1
the 1
State 1
for 1
the 1
State 1
officers 1
for 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
for 1
the 1
churches 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
for 1
Congress 1
for 1
the 1
President 1
for 1
the 1
officers 1
of 1
the 1
Government 1
for 1
poor 1
sailors 1
tossed 1
by 1
stormy 1
seas 1
for 1
the 1
oppressed 1
millions 1
groaning 1
under 1
the 1
heel 1
of 1
European 1
monarchies 1
and 1
Oriental 1
despotisms 1
for 1
such 1
as 1
have 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
tidings 1
and 1
yet 1
have 1
not 1
eyes 1
to 1
see 1
nor 1
ears 1
to 1
hear 1
withal 1
for 1
the 1
heathen 1
in 1
the 1
far 1
islands 1
of 1
the 1
sea 1
and 1
closed 1
with 1
a 1
supplication 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
speak 1
might 1
find 1
grace 1
and 1
favor 1
and 1
be 1
as 1
seed 1
sown 1
in 1
fertile 1
ground 1
yielding 1
in 1
time 1
a 1
grateful 1
harvest 1
of 1
good 1
Amen 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
rustling 1
of 1
dresses 1
and 1
the 1
standing 1
congregation 1
sat 1
down 1
The 1
boy 1
whose 1
history 1
this 1
book 1
relates 1
did 1
not 1
enjoy 1
the 1
prayer 1
he 1
only 1
endured 1
it 1
if 1
he 1
even 1
did 1
that 1
much 1
He 1
was 1
restive 1
all 1
through 1
it 1
he 1
kept 1
tally 1
of 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
the 1
prayer 1
unconsciously 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
listening 1
but 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
ground 1
of 1
old 1
and 1
the 1
clergyman 1
s 1
regular 1
route 1
over 1
it 1
and 1
when 1
a 1
little 1
trifle 1
of 1
new 1
matter 1
was 1
interlarded 1
his 1
ear 1
detected 1
it 1
and 1
his 1
whole 1
nature 1
resented 1
it 1
he 1
considered 1
additions 1
unfair 1
and 1
scoundrelly 1
In 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
the 1
prayer 1
a 1
fly 1
had 1
lit 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
pew 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
tortured 1
his 1
spirit 1
by 1
calmly 1
rubbing 1
its 1
hands 1
together 1
embracing 1
its 1
head 1
with 1
its 1
arms 1
and 1
polishing 1
it 1
so 1
vigorously 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
almost 1
part 1
company 1
with 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
the 1
slender 1
thread 1
of 1
a 1
neck 1
was 1
exposed 1
to 1
view 1
scraping 1
its 1
wings 1
with 1
its 1
hind 1
legs 1
and 1
smoothing 1
them 1
to 1
its 1
body 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
coat 1
tails 1
going 1
through 1
its 1
whole 1
toilet 1
as 1
tranquilly 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
knew 1
it 1
was 1
perfectly 1
safe 1
As 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
as 1
sorely 1
as 1
Tom 1
s 1
hands 1
itched 1
to 1
grab 1
for 1
it 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
dare 1
he 1
believed 1
his 1
soul 1
would 1
be 1
instantly 1
destroyed 1
if 1
he 1
did 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
while 1
the 1
prayer 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
But 1
with 1
the 1
closing 1
sentence 1
his 1
hand 1
began 1
to 1
curve 1
and 1
steal 1
forward 1
and 1
the 1
instant 1
the 1
Amen 1
was 1
out 1
the 1
fly 1
was 1
a 1
prisoner 1
of 1
war 1
His 1
aunt 1
detected 1
the 1
act 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
The 1
minister 1
gave 1
out 1
his 1
text 1
and 1
droned 1
along 1
monotonously 1
through 1
an 1
argument 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
prosy 1
that 1
many 1
a 1
head 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
began 1
to 1
nod 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
argument 1
that 1
dealt 1
in 1
limitless 1
fire 1
and 1
brimstone 1
and 1
thinned 1
the 1
predestined 1
elect 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
company 1
so 1
small 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
hardly 1
worth 1
the 1
saving 1
Tom 1
counted 1
the 1
pages 1
of 1
the 1
sermon 1
after 1
church 1
he 1
always 1
knew 1
how 1
many 1
pages 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
but 1
he 1
seldom 1
knew 1
anything 1
else 1
about 1
the 1
discourse 1
However 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
really 1
interested 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
The 1
minister 1
made 1
a 1
grand 1
and 1
moving 1
picture 1
of 1
the 1
assembling 1
together 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
s 1
hosts 1
at 1
the 1
millennium 1
when 1
the 1
lion 1
and 1
the 1
lamb 1
should 1
lie 1
down 1
together 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
child 1
should 1
lead 1
them 1
But 1
the 1
pathos 1
the 1
lesson 1
the 1
moral 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
spectacle 1
were 1
lost 1
upon 1
the 1
boy 1
he 1
only 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
conspicuousness 1
of 1
the 1
principal 1
character 1
before 1
the 1
on 1
looking 1
nations 1
his 1
face 1
lit 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
that 1
child 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
tame 1
lion 1
Now 1
he 1
lapsed 1
into 1
suffering 1
again 1
as 1
the 1
dry 1
argument 1
was 1
resumed 1
Presently 1
he 1
bethought 1
him 1
of 1
a 1
treasure 1
he 1
had 1
and 1
got 1
it 1
out 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
large 1
black 1
beetle 1
with 1
formidable 1
jaws 1
a 1
pinchbug 1
he 1
called 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
percussion 1
cap 1
box 1
The 1
first 1
thing 1
the 1
beetle 1
did 1
was 1
to 1
take 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
finger 1
A 1
natural 1
fillip 1
followed 1
the 1
beetle 1
went 1
floundering 1
into 1
the 1
aisle 1
and 1
lit 1
on 1
its 1
back 1
and 1
the 1
hurt 1
finger 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
mouth 1
The 1
beetle 1
lay 1
there 1
working 1
its 1
helpless 1
legs 1
unable 1
to 1
turn 1
over 1
Tom 1
eyed 1
it 1
and 1
longed 1
for 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
safe 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
reach 1
Other 1
people 1
uninterested 1
in 1
the 1
sermon 1
found 1
relief 1
in 1
the 1
beetle 1
and 1
they 1
eyed 1
it 1
too 1
Presently 1
a 1
vagrant 1
poodle 1
dog 1
came 1
idling 1
along 1
sad 1
at 1
heart 1
lazy 1
with 1
the 1
summer 1
softness 1
and 1
the 1
quiet 1
weary 1
of 1
captivity 1
sighing 1
for 1
change 1
He 1
spied 1
the 1
beetle 1
the 1
drooping 1
tail 1
lifted 1
and 1
wagged 1
He 1
surveyed 1
the 1
prize 1
walked 1
around 1
it 1
smelt 1
at 1
it 1
from 1
a 1
safe 1
distance 1
walked 1
around 1
it 1
again 1
grew 1
bolder 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
closer 1
smell 1
then 1
lifted 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
gingerly 1
snatch 1
at 1
it 1
just 1
missing 1
it 1
made 1
another 1
and 1
another 1
began 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
diversion 1
subsided 1
to 1
his 1
stomach 1
with 1
the 1
beetle 1
between 1
his 1
paws 1
and 1
continued 1
his 1
experiments 1
grew 1
weary 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
then 1
indifferent 1
and 1
absent 1
minded 1
His 1
head 1
nodded 1
and 1
little 1
by 1
little 1
his 1
chin 1
descended 1
and 1
touched 1
the 1
enemy 1
who 1
seized 1
it 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
sharp 1
yelp 1
a 1
flirt 1
of 1
the 1
poodle 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
the 1
beetle 1
fell 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
yards 1
away 1
and 1
lit 1
on 1
its 1
back 1
once 1
more 1
The 1
neighboring 1
spectators 1
shook 1
with 1
a 1
gentle 1
inward 1
joy 1
several 1
faces 1
went 1
behind 1
fans 1
and 1
hand 1
kerchiefs 1
and 1
Tom 1
was 1
entirely 1
happy 1
The 1
dog 1
looked 1
foolish 1
and 1
probably 1
felt 1
so 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
resentment 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
too 1
and 1
a 1
craving 1
for 1
revenge 1
So 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
beetle 1
and 1
began 1
a 1
wary 1
attack 1
on 1
it 1
again 1
jumping 1
at 1
it 1
from 1
every 1
point 1
of 1
a 1
circle 1
lighting 1
with 1
his 1
fore 1
paws 1
within 1
an 1
inch 1
of 1
the 1
creature 1
making 1
even 1
closer 1
snatches 1
at 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
jerking 1
his 1
head 1
till 1
his 1
ears 1
flapped 1
again 1
But 1
he 1
grew 1
tired 1
once 1
more 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
tried 1
to 1
amuse 1
himself 1
with 1
a 1
fly 1
but 1
found 1
no 1
relief 1
followed 1
an 1
ant 1
around 1
with 1
his 1
nose 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
quickly 1
wearied 1
of 1
that 1
yawned 1
sighed 1
forgot 1
the 1
beetle 1
entirely 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
it 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
yelp 1
of 1
agony 1
and 1
the 1
poodle 1
went 1
sailing 1
up 1
the 1
aisle 1
the 1
yelps 1
continued 1
and 1
so 1
did 1
the 1
dog 1
he 1
crossed 1
the 1
house 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
altar 1
he 1
flew 1
down 1
the 1
other 1
aisle 1
he 1
crossed 1
before 1
the 1
doors 1
he 1
clamored 1
up 1
the 1
home 1
stretch 1
his 1
anguish 1
grew 1
with 1
his 1
progress 1
till 1
presently 1
he 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
woolly 1
comet 1
moving 1
in 1
its 1
orbit 1
with 1
the 1
gleam 1
and 1
the 1
speed 1
of 1
light 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
frantic 1
sufferer 1
sheered 1
from 1
its 1
course 1
and 1
sprang 1
into 1
its 1
master 1
s 1
lap 1
he 1
flung 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
the 1
voice 1
of 1
distress 1
quickly 1
thinned 1
away 1
and 1
died 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
By 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
whole 1
church 1
was 1
red 1
faced 1
and 1
suffocating 1
with 1
suppressed 1
laughter 1
and 1
the 1
sermon 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
dead 1
standstill 1
The 1
discourse 1
was 1
resumed 1
presently 1
but 1
it 1
went 1
lame 1
and 1
halting 1
all 1
possibility 1
of 1
impressiveness 1
being 1
at 1
an 1
end 1
for 1
even 1
the 1
gravest 1
sentiments 1
were 1
constantly 1
being 1
received 1
with 1
a 1
smothered 1
burst 1
of 1
unholy 1
mirth 1
under 1
cover 1
of 1
some 1
remote 1
pew 1
back 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
poor 1
parson 1
had 1
said 1
a 1
rarely 1
facetious 1
thing 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
genuine 1
relief 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
congregation 1
when 1
the 1
ordeal 1
was 1
over 1
and 1
the 1
benediction 1
pronounced 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
went 1
home 1
quite 1
cheerful 1
thinking 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
satisfaction 1
about 1
divine 1
service 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
variety 1
in 1
it 1
He 1
had 1
but 1
one 1
marring 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
willing 1
that 1
the 1
dog 1
should 1
play 1
with 1
his 1
pinchbug 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
upright 1
in 1
him 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
off 1
CHAPTER 1
VI 1
MONDAY 1
morning 1
found 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
miserable 1
Monday 1
morning 1
always 1
found 1
him 1
so 1
because 1
it 1
began 1
another 1
week 1
s 1
slow 1
suffering 1
in 1
school 1
He 1
generally 1
began 1
that 1
day 1
with 1
wishing 1
he 1
had 1
had 1
no 1
intervening 1
holiday 1
it 1
made 1
the 1
going 1
into 1
captivity 1
and 1
fetters 1
again 1
so 1
much 1
more 1
odious 1
Tom 1
lay 1
thinking 1
Presently 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
wished 1
he 1
was 1
sick 1
then 1
he 1
could 1
stay 1
home 1
from 1
school 1
Here 1
was 1
a 1
vague 1
possibility 1
He 1
canvassed 1
his 1
system 1
No 1
ailment 1
was 1
found 1
and 1
he 1
investigated 1
again 1
This 1
time 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
could 1
detect 1
colicky 1
symptoms 1
and 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
encourage 1
them 1
with 1
considerable 1
hope 1
But 1
they 1
soon 1
grew 1
feeble 1
and 1
presently 1
died 1
wholly 1
away 1
He 1
reflected 1
further 1
Suddenly 1
he 1
discovered 1
something 1
One 1
of 1
his 1
upper 1
front 1
teeth 1
was 1
loose 1
This 1
was 1
lucky 1
he 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
begin 1
to 1
groan 1
as 1
a 1
starter 1
as 1
he 1
called 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
court 1
with 1
that 1
argument 1
his 1
aunt 1
would 1
pull 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
that 1
would 1
hurt 1
So 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
hold 1
the 1
tooth 1
in 1
reserve 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
and 1
seek 1
further 1
Nothing 1
offered 1
for 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
remembered 1
hearing 1
the 1
doctor 1
tell 1
about 1
a 1
certain 1
thing 1
that 1
laid 1
up 1
a 1
patient 1
for 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
weeks 1
and 1
threatened 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
lose 1
a 1
finger 1
So 1
the 1
boy 1
eagerly 1
drew 1
his 1
sore 1
toe 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
sheet 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
up 1
for 1
inspection 1
But 1
now 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
the 1
necessary 1
symptoms 1
However 1
it 1
seemed 1
well 1
worth 1
while 1
to 1
chance 1
it 1
so 1
he 1
fell 1
to 1
groaning 1
with 1
considerable 1
spirit 1
But 1
Sid 1
slept 1
on 1
unconscious 1
Tom 1
groaned 1
louder 1
and 1
fancied 1
that 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
pain 1
in 1
the 1
toe 1
No 1
result 1
from 1
Sid 1
Tom 1
was 1
panting 1
with 1
his 1
exertions 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
He 1
took 1
a 1
rest 1
and 1
then 1
swelled 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
fetched 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
admirable 1
groans 1
Sid 1
snored 1
on 1
Tom 1
was 1
aggravated 1
He 1
said 1
Sid 1
Sid 1
and 1
shook 1
him 1
This 1
course 1
worked 1
well 1
and 1
Tom 1
began 1
to 1
groan 1
again 1
Sid 1
yawned 1
stretched 1
then 1
brought 1
himself 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
elbow 1
with 1
a 1
snort 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
stare 1
at 1
Tom 1
Tom 1
went 1
on 1
groaning 1
Sid 1
said 1
Tom 1
Say 1
Tom 1
No 1
response 1
Here 1
Tom 1
TOM 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
Tom 1
And 1
he 1
shook 1
him 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
anxiously 1
Tom 1
moaned 1
out 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
Sid 1
Don 1
t 1
joggle 1
me 1
Why 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
Tom 1
I 1
must 1
call 1
auntie 1
No 1
never 1
mind 1
It 1
ll 1
be 1
over 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
maybe 1
Don 1
t 1
call 1
anybody 1
But 1
I 1
must 1
Don 1
t 1
groan 1
so 1
Tom 1
it 1
s 1
awful 1
How 1
long 1
you 1
been 1
this 1
way 1
Hours 1
Ouch 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
stir 1
so 1
Sid 1
you 1
ll 1
kill 1
me 1
Tom 1
why 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
wake 1
me 1
sooner 1
Oh 1
Tom 1
don 1
t 1
It 1
makes 1
my 1
flesh 1
crawl 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
Tom 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
forgive 1
you 1
everything 1
Sid 1
Groan 1
Everything 1
you 1
ve 1
ever 1
done 1
to 1
me 1
When 1
I 1
m 1
gone 1
Oh 1
Tom 1
you 1
ain 1
t 1
dying 1
are 1
you 1
Don 1
t 1
Tom 1
oh 1
don 1
t 1
Maybe 1
I 1
forgive 1
everybody 1
Sid 1
Groan 1
Tell 1
em 1
so 1
Sid 1
And 1
Sid 1
you 1
give 1
my 1
window 1
sash 1
and 1
my 1
cat 1
with 1
one 1
eye 1
to 1
that 1
new 1
girl 1
that 1
s 1
come 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
tell 1
her 1
But 1
Sid 1
had 1
snatched 1
his 1
clothes 1
and 1
gone 1
Tom 1
was 1
suffering 1
in 1
reality 1
now 1
so 1
handsomely 1
was 1
his 1
imagination 1
working 1
and 1
so 1
his 1
groans 1
had 1
gathered 1
quite 1
a 1
genuine 1
tone 1
Sid 1
flew 1
downstairs 1
and 1
said 1
Oh 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
come 1
Tom 1
s 1
dying 1
Dying 1
Yes 1
m 1
Don 1
t 1
wait 1
come 1
quick 1
Rubbage 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
it 1
But 1
she 1
fled 1
upstairs 1
nevertheless 1
with 1
Sid 1
and 1
Mary 1
at 1
her 1
heels 1
And 1
her 1
face 1
grew 1
white 1
too 1
and 1
her 1
lip 1
trembled 1
When 1
she 1
reached 1
the 1
bedside 1
she 1
gasped 1
out 1
You 1
Tom 1
Tom 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
Oh 1
auntie 1
I 1
m 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
child 1
Oh 1
auntie 1
my 1
sore 1
toe 1
s 1
mortified 1
The 1
old 1
lady 1
sank 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
laughed 1
a 1
little 1
then 1
cried 1
a 1
little 1
then 1
did 1
both 1
together 1
This 1
restored 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
Tom 1
what 1
a 1
turn 1
you 1
did 1
give 1
me 1
Now 1
you 1
shut 1
up 1
that 1
nonsense 1
and 1
climb 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
The 1
groans 1
ceased 1
and 1
the 1
pain 1
vanished 1
from 1
the 1
toe 1
The 1
boy 1
felt 1
a 1
little 1
foolish 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
it 1
seemed 1
mortified 1
and 1
it 1
hurt 1
so 1
I 1
never 1
minded 1
my 1
tooth 1
at 1
all 1
Your 1
tooth 1
indeed 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
your 1
tooth 1
One 1
of 1
them 1
s 1
loose 1
and 1
it 1
aches 1
perfectly 1
awful 1
There 1
there 1
now 1
don 1
t 1
begin 1
that 1
groaning 1
again 1
Open 1
your 1
mouth 1
Well 1
your 1
tooth 1
is 1
loose 1
but 1
you 1
re 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
about 1
that 1
Mary 1
get 1
me 1
a 1
silk 1
thread 1
and 1
a 1
chunk 1
of 1
fire 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
Tom 1
said 1
Oh 1
please 1
auntie 1
don 1
t 1
pull 1
it 1
out 1
It 1
don 1
t 1
hurt 1
any 1
more 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
may 1
never 1
stir 1
if 1
it 1
does 1
Please 1
don 1
t 1
auntie 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
stay 1
home 1
from 1
school 1
Oh 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
So 1
all 1
this 1
row 1
was 1
because 1
you 1
thought 1
you 1
d 1
get 1
to 1
stay 1
home 1
from 1
school 1
and 1
go 1
a 1
fishing 1
Tom 1
Tom 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
so 1
and 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
try 1
every 1
way 1
you 1
can 1
to 1
break 1
my 1
old 1
heart 1
with 1
your 1
outrageousness 1
By 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
dental 1
instruments 1
were 1
ready 1
The 1
old 1
lady 1
made 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
silk 1
thread 1
fast 1
to 1
Tom 1
s 1
tooth 1
with 1
a 1
loop 1
and 1
tied 1
the 1
other 1
to 1
the 1
bedpost 1
Then 1
she 1
seized 1
the 1
chunk 1
of 1
fire 1
and 1
suddenly 1
thrust 1
it 1
almost 1
into 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
face 1
The 1
tooth 1
hung 1
dangling 1
by 1
the 1
bedpost 1
now 1
But 1
all 1
trials 1
bring 1
their 1
compensations 1
As 1
Tom 1
wended 1
to 1
school 1
after 1
breakfast 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
envy 1
of 1
every 1
boy 1
he 1
met 1
because 1
the 1
gap 1
in 1
his 1
upper 1
row 1
of 1
teeth 1
enabled 1
him 1
to 1
expectorate 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
admirable 1
way 1
He 1
gathered 1
quite 1
a 1
following 1
of 1
lads 1
interested 1
in 1
the 1
exhibition 1
and 1
one 1
that 1
had 1
cut 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
centre 1
of 1
fascination 1
and 1
homage 1
up 1
to 1
this 1
time 1
now 1
found 1
himself 1
suddenly 1
without 1
an 1
adherent 1
and 1
shorn 1
of 1
his 1
glory 1
His 1
heart 1
was 1
heavy 1
and 1
he 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
disdain 1
which 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
that 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
anything 1
to 1
spit 1
like 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
but 1
another 1
boy 1
said 1
Sour 1
grapes 1
and 1
he 1
wandered 1
away 1
a 1
dismantled 1
hero 1
Shortly 1
Tom 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
juvenile 1
pariah 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
Huckleberry 1
Finn 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
drunkard 1
Huckleberry 1
was 1
cordially 1
hated 1
and 1
dreaded 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
mothers 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
idle 1
and 1
lawless 1
and 1
vulgar 1
and 1
bad 1
and 1
because 1
all 1
their 1
children 1
admired 1
him 1
so 1
and 1
delighted 1
in 1
his 1
forbidden 1
society 1
and 1
wished 1
they 1
dared 1
to 1
be 1
like 1
him 1
Tom 1
was 1
like 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
respectable 1
boys 1
in 1
that 1
he 1
envied 1
Huckleberry 1
his 1
gaudy 1
outcast 1
condition 1
and 1
was 1
under 1
strict 1
orders 1
not 1
to 1
play 1
with 1
him 1
So 1
he 1
played 1
with 1
him 1
every 1
time 1
he 1
got 1
a 1
chance 1
Huckleberry 1
was 1
always 1
dressed 1
in 1
the 1
cast 1
off 1
clothes 1
of 1
full 1
grown 1
men 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
in 1
perennial 1
bloom 1
and 1
fluttering 1
with 1
rags 1
His 1
hat 1
was 1
a 1
vast 1
ruin 1
with 1
a 1
wide 1
crescent 1
lopped 1
out 1
of 1
its 1
brim 1
his 1
coat 1
when 1
he 1
wore 1
one 1
hung 1
nearly 1
to 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
rearward 1
buttons 1
far 1
down 1
the 1
back 1
but 1
one 1
suspender 1
supported 1
his 1
trousers 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
the 1
trousers 1
bagged 1
low 1
and 1
contained 1
nothing 1
the 1
fringed 1
legs 1
dragged 1
in 1
the 1
dirt 1
when 1
not 1
rolled 1
up 1
Huckleberry 1
came 1
and 1
went 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
free 1
will 1
He 1
slept 1
on 1
doorsteps 1
in 1
fine 1
weather 1
and 1
in 1
empty 1
hogsheads 1
in 1
wet 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
school 1
or 1
to 1
church 1
or 1
call 1
any 1
being 1
master 1
or 1
obey 1
anybody 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
fishing 1
or 1
swimming 1
when 1
and 1
where 1
he 1
chose 1
and 1
stay 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
suited 1
him 1
nobody 1
forbade 1
him 1
to 1
fight 1
he 1
could 1
sit 1
up 1
as 1
late 1
as 1
he 1
pleased 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
first 1
boy 1
that 1
went 1
barefoot 1
in 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
to 1
resume 1
leather 1
in 1
the 1
fall 1
he 1
never 1
had 1
to 1
wash 1
nor 1
put 1
on 1
clean 1
clothes 1
he 1
could 1
swear 1
wonderfully 1
In 1
a 1
word 1
everything 1
that 1
goes 1
to 1
make 1
life 1
precious 1
that 1
boy 1
had 1
So 1
thought 1
every 1
harassed 1
hampered 1

boy 1
in 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
Tom 1

romantic 1
outcast 1

In 1

Certainly 1
With 1

Yes 1

Did 1

Aha 1
Talk 1

way 1
as 1

Why 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1

You 1

to 1
go 1
all 1
by 1

middle 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
where 1
you 1

stump 1
and 1
just 1

eleven 1
steps 1
with 1
your 1
eyes 1
shut 1
and 1
then 1
turn 1
around 1
three 1
times 1
and 1
walk 1
home 1
without 1
speaking 1
to 1
anybody 1
Because 1
if 1
you 1
speak 1
the 1
charm 1
s 1
busted 1
Well 1
that 1
sounds 1
like 1
a 1
good 1
way 1
but 1
that 1

t 1
the 1
way 1
Bob 1
Tanner 1

No 1
sir 1
you 1
can 1
bet 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
becuz 1
he 1
s 1
the 1
wartiest 1
boy 1
in 1
this 1
town 1
and 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1

a 1
wart 1
on 1

if 1
he 1

I 1

took 1
off 1
thousands 1
of 1
warts 1
off 1
of 1
my 1
hands 1
that 1
way 1
Huck 1
I 1
play 1
with 1
frogs 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
I 1
ve 1
always 1
got 1
considerable 1
many 1
warts 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
take 1
em 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
bean 1
Yes 1
bean 1
s 1
good 1
I 1
ve 1
done 1
that 1
Have 1
you 1
What 1
s 1
your 1
way 1
You 1
take 1
and 1
split 1
the 1
bean 1
and 1
cut 1
the 1
wart 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
blood 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
put 1
the 1
blood 1
on 1
one 1
piece 1
of 1
the 1
bean 1
and 1
take 1
and 1
dig 1
a 1
hole 1
and 1
bury 1
it 1
bout 1
midnight 1
at 1
the 1
crossroads 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
of 1
the 1
moon 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
burn 1
up 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
bean 1
You 1
see 1
that 1
piece 1
that 1
s 1
got 1
the 1
blood 1
on 1
it 1
will 1
keep 1
drawing 1
and 1
drawing 1
trying 1
to 1
fetch 1
the 1
other 1
piece 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
helps 1
the 1
blood 1
to 1
draw 1
the 1
wart 1
and 1
pretty 1
soon 1
off 1
she 1

Yes 1

go 1
and 1
get 1

the 1
grave 1
yard 1

about 1
midnight 1
when 1
somebody 1
that 1

has 1
been 1
buried 1
and 1
when 1

a 1
devil 1

Say 1
Huck 1
I 1

Less 1
see 1
it 1
Tom 1
got 1
out 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
carefully 1
unrolled 1
it 1
Huckleberry 1
viewed 1
it 1
wistfully 1
The 1
temptation 1
was 1
very 1
strong 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
Is 1
it 1
genuwyne 1
Tom 1
lifted 1
his 1
lip 1
and 1
showed 1
the 1
vacancy 1
Well 1
all 1
right 1
said 1
Huckleberry 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
trade 1
Tom 1
enclosed 1
the 1
tick 1
in 1
the 1
percussion 1
cap 1
box 1
that 1
had 1
lately 1
been 1
the 1
pinchbug 1
s 1
prison 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
separated 1
each 1
feeling 1
wealthier 1
than 1
before 1
When 1
Tom 1
reached 1
the 1
little 1
isolated 1
frame 1
school 1
house 1
he 1
strode 1
in 1
briskly 1
with 1
the 1
manner 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
come 1
with 1
all 1
honest 1
speed 1
He 1
hung 1
his 1
hat 1
on 1
a 1
peg 1
and 1
flung 1
himself 1
into 1
his 1
seat 1
with 1
business 1
like 1
alacrity 1
The 1
master 1
throned 1
on 1
high 1
in 1
his 1
great 1
splint 1
bottom 1
arm 1
chair 1
was 1
dozing 1
lulled 1
by 1
the 1
drowsy 1
hum 1
of 1

The 1
interruption 1
roused 1
him 1
Thomas 1
Sawyer 1
Tom 1
knew 1
that 1
when 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
pronounced 1
in 1
full 1
it 1
meant 1
trouble 1
Sir 1
Come 1
up 1
here 1
Now 1
sir 1
why 1
are 1
you 1
late 1
again 1
as 1
usual 1
Tom 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
take 1
refuge 1
in 1
a 1
lie 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
two 1
long 1
tails 1
of 1
yellow 1
hair 1
hanging 1
down 1
a 1
back 1
that 1
he 1
recognized 1
by 1
the 1
electric 1
sympathy 1
of 1
love 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
form 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
vacant 1
place 1
on 1
the 1
girls 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
school 1
house 1
He 1
instantly 1
said 1
I 1
stopped 1
to 1
talk 1
with 1
Huckleberry 1
Finn 1
The 1
master 1
s 1
pulse 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
he 1
stared 1
helplessly 1
The 1
buzz 1
of 1
study 1
ceased 1
The 1
pupils 1
wondered 1
if 1
this 1
foolhardy 1
boy 1
had 1
lost 1
his 1
mind 1
The 1
master 1
said 1
You 1
you 1
did 1
what 1
Stopped 1
to 1
talk 1
with 1
Huckleberry 1
Finn 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
mistaking 1
the 1
words 1
Thomas 1
Sawyer 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
astounding 1
confession 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
No 1
mere 1
ferule 1
will 1
answer 1
for 1
this 1
offence 1
Take 1
off 1
your 1
jacket 1
The 1
master 1
s 1
arm 1
performed 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
tired 1
and 1
the 1
stock 1
of 1
switches 1
notably 1
diminished 1
Then 1
the 1
order 1
followed 1
Now 1
sir 1
go 1
and 1
sit 1
with 1
the 1
girls 1
And 1
let 1
this 1
be 1
a 1
warning 1
to 1
you 1
The 1
titter 1
that 1
rippled 1
around 1
the 1
room 1
appeared 1
to 1
abash 1
the 1
boy 1
but 1
in 1
reality 1
that 1
result 1
was 1
caused 1
rather 1
more 1
by 1
his 1
worshipful 1
awe 1
of 1
his 1
unknown 1
idol 1
and 1
the 1
dread 1
pleasure 1
that 1
lay 1
in 1
his 1
high 1
good 1
fortune 1
He 1
sat 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
pine 1
bench 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
hitched 1
herself 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
toss 1
of 1
her 1
head 1
Nudges 1
and 1
winks 1
and 1
whispers 1
traversed 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
Tom 1
sat 1
still 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
upon 1
the 1
long 1
low 1
desk 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
study 1
his 1
book 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
attention 1
ceased 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
accustomed 1
school 1
murmur 1
rose 1
upon 1
the 1
dull 1
air 1
once 1
more 1
Presently 1
the 1
boy 1
began 1
to 1
steal 1
furtive 1
glances 1
at 1
the 1
girl 1
She 1
observed 1
it 1
made 1
a 1
mouth 1
at 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
her 1
head 1
for 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
a 1
minute 1
When 1
she 1
cautiously 1
faced 1
around 1
again 1
a 1
peach 1
lay 1
before 1
her 1
She 1
thrust 1
it 1
away 1
Tom 1
gently 1
put 1
it 1
back 1
She 1
thrust 1
it 1
away 1
again 1
but 1
with 1
less 1
animosity 1
Tom 1
patiently 1
returned 1
it 1
to 1
its 1
place 1
Then 1
she 1
let 1
it 1
remain 1
Tom 1
scrawled 1
on 1
his 1
slate 1
Please 1
take 1
it 1
I 1
got 1
more 1
The 1
girl 1
glanced 1
at 1
the 1
words 1
but 1
made 1
no 1
sign 1
Now 1
the 1
boy 1
began 1
to 1
draw 1
something 1
on 1
the 1
slate 1
hiding 1
his 1
work 1
with 1
his 1
left 1
hand 1
For 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
girl 1
refused 1
to 1
notice 1
but 1
her 1
human 1
curiosity 1
presently 1
began 1
to 1
manifest 1
itself 1
by 1
hardly 1
perceptible 1
signs 1
The 1
boy 1
worked 1
on 1
apparently 1
unconscious 1
The 1
girl 1
made 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
non 1
committal 1
attempt 1
to 1
see 1
but 1
the 1
boy 1
did 1
not 1
betray 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
aware 1
of 1
it 1
At 1
last 1
she 1
gave 1
in 1
and 1
hesitatingly 1
whispered 1
Let 1
me 1
see 1
it 1
Tom 1
partly 1
uncovered 1
a 1
dismal 1
caricature 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
with 1
two 1
gable 1
ends 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
a 1
corkscrew 1
of 1
smoke 1
issuing 1
from 1
the 1
chimney 1
Then 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
interest 1
began 1
to 1
fasten 1
itself 1
upon 1
the 1
work 1
and 1
she 1
forgot 1
everything 1
else 1
When 1
it 1
was 1
finished 1
she 1
gazed 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
whispered 1
It 1
s 1
nice 1
make 1
a 1
man 1
The 1
artist 1
erected 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
yard 1
that 1
resembled 1
a 1
derrick 1
He 1
could 1
have 1
stepped 1
over 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
not 1
hypercritical 1
she 1
was 1
satisfied 1
with 1
the 1
monster 1
and 1
whispered 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
beautiful 1
man 1
now 1
make 1
me 1
coming 1
along 1
Tom 1
drew 1
an 1
hour 1
glass 1
with 1
a 1
full 1
moon 1
and 1
straw 1
limbs 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
armed 1
the 1
spreading 1
fingers 1
with 1
a 1
portentous 1
fan 1
The 1
girl 1
said 1
It 1
s 1
ever 1
so 1
nice 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
could 1
draw 1
It 1
s 1
easy 1
whispered 1
Tom 1
I 1
ll 1
learn 1
you 1
Oh 1
will 1
you 1
When 1
At 1
noon 1
Do 1
you 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
dinner 1
I 1
ll 1
stay 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
Good 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
whack 1
What 1
s 1
your 1
name 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
What 1
s 1
yours 1
Oh 1
I 1
know 1
It 1
s 1
Thomas 1
Sawyer 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
name 1
they 1
lick 1
me 1
by 1
I 1
m 1
Tom 1
when 1
I 1
m 1
good 1
You 1
call 1
me 1
Tom 1
will 1
you 1
Yes 1
Now 1
Tom 1
began 1
to 1
scrawl 1
something 1
on 1
the 1
slate 1
hiding 1
the 1
words 1
from 1
the 1
girl 1
But 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
backward 1
this 1
time 1
She 1
begged 1
to 1
see 1
Tom 1
said 1
Oh 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
anything 1
Yes 1
it 1
is 1
No 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
Yes 1
I 1
do 1
indeed 1
I 1
do 1
Please 1
let 1
me 1
You 1
ll 1
tell 1
No 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
deed 1
and 1
deed 1
and 1
double 1
deed 1
won 1
t 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
tell 1
anybody 1
at 1
all 1
Ever 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
you 1
live 1
No 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
ever 1
tell 1
any 1
body 1
Now 1
let 1
me 1
Oh 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
Now 1
that 1
you 1
treat 1
me 1
so 1
I 1
will 1
see 1
And 1
she 1
put 1
her 1
small 1
hand 1
upon 1
his 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
scuffle 1
ensued 1
Tom 1
pretending 1
to 1
resist 1
in 1
earnest 1
but 1
letting 1
his 1
hand 1
slip 1
by 1
degrees 1
till 1
these 1
words 1
were 1
revealed 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
Oh 1
you 1
bad 1
thing 1
And 1
she 1
hit 1
his 1
hand 1
a 1
smart 1
rap 1
but 1
reddened 1
and 1
looked 1
pleased 1
nevertheless 1
Just 1
at 1
this 1
juncture 1
the 1
boy 1
felt 1
a 1
slow 1
fateful 1
grip 1
closing 1
on 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
a 1
steady 1
lifting 1
impulse 1
In 1
that 1
wise 1
he 1
was 1
borne 1
across 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
deposited 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
seat 1
under 1
a 1
peppering 1
fire 1
of 1
giggles 1
from 1
the 1
whole 1
school 1
Then 1
the 1
master 1
stood 1
over 1
him 1
during 1
a 1
few 1
awful 1
moments 1
and 1
finally 1
moved 1
away 1
to 1
his 1
throne 1
without 1
saying 1
a 1
word 1
But 1
although 1
Tom 1
s 1
ear 1
tingled 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
jubilant 1
As 1
the 1
school 1
quieted 1
down 1
Tom 1
made 1
an 1
honest 1
effort 1
to 1
study 1
but 1
the 1
turmoil 1
within 1
him 1
was 1
too 1
great 1
In 1
turn 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
reading 1
class 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
botch 1
of 1
it 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
geography 1
class 1
and 1
turned 1
lakes 1
into 1
mountains 1
mountains 1
into 1
rivers 1
and 1
rivers 1
into 1
continents 1
till 1
chaos 1
was 1
come 1
again 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
spelling 1
class 1
and 1
got 1
turned 1
down 1
by 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
mere 1
baby 1
words 1
till 1
he 1
brought 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
and 1
yielded 1
up 1
the 1
pewter 1
medal 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
worn 1
with 1
ostentation 1
for 1
months 1
CHAPTER 1
VII 1
THE 1
harder 1
Tom 1
tried 1
to 1
fasten 1
his 1
mind 1
on 1
his 1
book 1
the 1
more 1
his 1
ideas 1
wandered 1
So 1
at 1
last 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
and 1
a 1
yawn 1
he 1
gave 1
it 1
up 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
noon 1
recess 1
would 1
never 1
come 1
The 1
air 1
was 1
utterly 1
dead 1
There 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
breath 1
stirring 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
sleepiest 1
of 1
sleepy 1
days 1
The 1
drowsing 1
murmur 1
of 1
the 1
five 1
and 1
twenty 1
studying 1
scholars 1
soothed 1
the 1
soul 1
like 1
the 1
spell 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
murmur 1
of 1
bees 1
Away 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
flaming 1
sunshine 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
lifted 1
its 1
soft 1
green 1
sides 1
through 1
a 1
shimmering 1
veil 1
of 1
heat 1
tinted 1
with 1
the 1
purple 1
of 1
distance 1
a 1
few 1
birds 1
floated 1
on 1
lazy 1
wing 1
high 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
no 1
other 1
living 1
thing 1
was 1
visible 1
but 1
some 1
cows 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
asleep 1
Tom 1
s 1
heart 1
ached 1
to 1
be 1
free 1
or 1
else 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
of 1
interest 1
to 1
do 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
dreary 1
time 1
His 1
hand 1
wandered 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
lit 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
glow 1
of 1
gratitude 1
that 1
was 1
prayer 1
though 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
it 1
Then 1
furtively 1
the 1
percussion 1
cap 1
box 1
came 1
out 1
He 1
released 1
the 1
tick 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
on 1
the 1
long 1
flat 1
desk 1
The 1
creature 1
probably 1
glowed 1
with 1
a 1
gratitude 1
that 1
amounted 1
to 1
prayer 1
too 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
premature 1
for 1
when 1
he 1
started 1
thankfully 1
to 1
travel 1
off 1
Tom 1
turned 1
him 1
aside 1
with 1
a 1
pin 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
take 1
a 1
new 1
direction 1
Tom 1
s 1
bosom 1
friend 1
sat 1
next 1
him 1
suffering 1
just 1
as 1
Tom 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
and 1
gratefully 1
interested 1
in 1
this 1
entertainment 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
This 1
bosom 1
friend 1
was 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
The 1
two 1
boys 1
were 1
sworn 1
friends 1
all 1
the 1
week 1
and 1
embattled 1
enemies 1
on 1
Saturdays 1
Joe 1
took 1
a 1
pin 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
lapel 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
assist 1
in 1
exercising 1
the 1
prisoner 1
The 1
sport 1
grew 1
in 1
interest 1
momently 1
Soon 1
Tom 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
interfering 1
with 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
neither 1
getting 1
the 1
fullest 1
benefit 1
of 1
the 1
tick 1
So 1
he 1
put 1
Joe 1
s 1
slate 1
on 1
the 1
desk 1
and 1
drew 1
a 1
line 1
down 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
from 1
top 1
to 1
bottom 1
Now 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
on 1
your 1
side 1
you 1
can 1
stir 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
let 1
him 1
get 1
away 1
and 1
get 1
on 1
my 1
side 1
you 1
re 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
can 1
keep 1
him 1
from 1
crossing 1
over 1
All 1
right 1
go 1
ahead 1
start 1
him 1
up 1
The 1
tick 1
escaped 1
from 1
Tom 1
presently 1
and 1
crossed 1
the 1
equator 1
Joe 1
harassed 1
him 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
got 1
away 1
and 1
crossed 1
back 1
again 1
This 1
change 1
of 1
base 1
occurred 1
often 1
While 1
one 1
boy 1
was 1
worrying 1
the 1
tick 1
with 1
absorbing 1
interest 1
the 1
other 1
would 1
look 1
on 1
with 1
interest 1
as 1
strong 1
the 1
two 1
heads 1
bowed 1
together 1
over 1
the 1
slate 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
souls 1
dead 1
to 1
all 1
things 1
else 1
At 1
last 1
luck 1
seemed 1
to 1
settle 1
and 1
abide 1
with 1
Joe 1
The 1
tick 1
tried 1
this 1
that 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
course 1
and 1
got 1
as 1
excited 1
and 1
as 1
anxious 1
as 1
the 1
boys 1
themselves 1
but 1
time 1
and 1
again 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
victory 1
in 1
his 1
very 1
grasp 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
fingers 1
would 1
be 1
twitching 1
to 1
begin 1
Joe 1
s 1
pin 1
would 1
deftly 1
head 1
him 1
off 1
and 1
keep 1
possession 1
At 1
last 1
Tom 1
could 1
stand 1
it 1
no 1
longer 1
The 1
temptation 1
was 1
too 1
strong 1
So 1
he 1
reached 1
out 1
and 1
lent 1
a 1
hand 1
with 1
his 1
pin 1
Joe 1
was 1
angry 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
Said 1
he 1
Tom 1
you 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
I 1
only 1
just 1
want 1
to 1
stir 1
him 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
Joe 1
No 1
sir 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
fair 1
you 1
just 1
let 1
him 1
alone 1
Blame 1
it 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
going 1
to 1

Let 1

You 1

Look 1

with 1

or 1

A 1
tremendous 1
whack 1
came 1
down 1
on 1
Tom 1
s 1
shoulders 1
and 1
its 1
duplicate 1
on 1
Joe 1
s 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
two 1
minutes 1
the 1
dust 1
continued 1
to 1
fly 1
from 1
the 1
two 1
jackets 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
school 1
to 1
enjoy 1
it 1
The 1
boys 1
had 1
been 1
too 1
absorbed 1
to 1
notice 1
the 1
hush 1
that 1
had 1
stolen 1
upon 1
the 1
school 1
awhile 1
before 1
when 1
the 1
master 1
came 1
tiptoeing 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
stood 1
over 1
them 1
He 1
had 1
contemplated 1
a 1
good 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
performance 1
before 1
he 1
contributed 1
his 1
bit 1
of 1
variety 1
to 1
it 1
When 1
school 1
broke 1
up 1
at 1
noon 1
Tom 1
flew 1
to 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
and 1
whispered 1
in 1
her 1
ear 1
Put 1
on 1
your 1
bonnet 1
and 1
let 1
on 1
you 1
re 1
going 1
home 1
and 1
when 1
you 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
give 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
em 1
the 1
slip 1
and 1
turn 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
come 1
back 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
the 1
other 1
way 1
and 1
come 1
it 1
over 1
em 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
So 1
the 1
one 1
went 1
off 1
with 1
one 1
group 1
of 1
scholars 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
with 1
another 1
In 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
the 1
two 1
met 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
school 1
they 1
had 1
it 1
all 1
to 1
themselves 1
Then 1
they 1
sat 1
together 1
with 1
a 1
slate 1
before 1
them 1
and 1
Tom 1
gave 1
Becky 1
the 1
pencil 1
and 1
held 1
her 1
hand 1
in 1
his 1
guiding 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
created 1
another 1
surprising 1
house 1
When 1
the 1
interest 1
in 1
art 1
began 1
to 1
wane 1
the 1
two 1
fell 1
to 1
talking 1
Tom 1
was 1
swimming 1
in 1
bliss 1
He 1
said 1
Do 1
you 1
love 1
rats 1
No 1
I 1
hate 1
them 1
Well 1
I 1
do 1
too 1
live 1
ones 1
But 1
I 1
mean 1
dead 1
ones 1
to 1
swing 1
round 1
your 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
string 1
No 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
rats 1
much 1
anyway 1
What 1
I 1
like 1
is 1
chewing 1
gum 1
Oh 1
I 1
should 1
say 1
so 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
had 1
some 1
now 1
Do 1
you 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
some 1
I 1
ll 1
let 1
you 1
chew 1
it 1
awhile 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
give 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
That 1
was 1
agreeable 1
so 1
they 1
chewed 1
it 1
turn 1
about 1
and 1
dangled 1
their 1
legs 1
against 1
the 1
bench 1
in 1
excess 1
of 1
contentment 1
Was 1
you 1
ever 1
at 1
a 1
circus 1
said 1
Tom 1
Yes 1

Becky 1
I 1

whisper 1

I 1
ll 1
whisper 1
it 1
ever 1
so 1
easy 1
Becky 1
hesitating 1
Tom 1
took 1
silence 1
for 1
consent 1
and 1
passed 1
his 1
arm 1
about 1
her 1
waist 1
and 1
whispered 1
the 1
tale 1
ever 1
so 1
softly 1
with 1
his 1
mouth 1
close 1
to 1
her 1
ear 1
And 1
then 1
he 1
added 1
Now 1
you 1
whisper 1
it 1
to 1
me 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
She 1
resisted 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
You 1
turn 1
your 1
face 1
away 1
so 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
see 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
will 1
But 1

won 1
t 1
will 1

No 1
indeed 1
indeed 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
Now 1
Becky 1
He 1
turned 1
his 1
face 1
away 1
She 1
bent 1
timidly 1
around 1
till 1
her 1
breath 1
stirred 1
his 1
curls 1
and 1
whispered 1
I 1
love 1
you 1
Then 1
she 1
sprang 1
away 1
and 1
ran 1
around 1
and 1
around 1
the 1
desks 1
and 1
benches 1
with 1
Tom 1
after 1
her 1
and 1
took 1
refuge 1
in 1
a 1
corner 1
at 1
last 1
with 1
her 1
little 1
white 1
apron 1
to 1
her 1
face 1
Tom 1
clasped 1
her 1
about 1
her 1
neck 1
and 1
pleaded 1
Now 1
Becky 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
done 1
all 1
over 1
but 1
the 1
kiss 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
that 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
anything 1
at 1
all 1
Please 1
Becky 1
And 1
he 1
tugged 1
at 1
her 1
apron 1
and 1
the 1
hands 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
she 1
gave 1
up 1
and 1
let 1
her 1
hands 1
drop 1
her 1
face 1
all 1
glowing 1
with 1
the 1
struggle 1
came 1
up 1
and 1
submitted 1
Tom 1
kissed 1
the 1
red 1
lips 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
done 1
Becky 1
And 1
always 1
after 1
this 1
you 1
know 1
you 1

to 1
love 1
anybody 1
but 1

and 1

anybody 1
but 1

and 1

Will 1

No 1
I 1
ll 1
never 1

anybody 1
but 1

Tom 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
never 1
marry 1
anybody 1
but 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
ain 1
t 1
to 1
ever 1
marry 1
anybody 1
but 1
me 1
either 1
Certainly 1
Of 1
course 1
That 1
s 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
always 1
coming 1
to 1
school 1
or 1
when 1
we 1
re 1
going 1
home 1
you 1
re 1
to 1
walk 1
with 1
me 1
when 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
anybody 1
looking 1
and 1
you 1
choose 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
choose 1
you 1
at 1
parties 1
because 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
way 1
you 1
do 1
when 1
you 1
re 1
engaged 1
It 1
s 1
so 1
nice 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
of 1
it 1
before 1
Oh 1
it 1
s 1
ever 1
so 1
gay 1
Why 1
me 1
and 1
Amy 1
Lawrence 1
The 1
big 1
eyes 1
told 1
Tom 1
his 1
blunder 1
and 1
he 1
stopped 1
confused 1
Oh 1
Tom 1
Then 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
first 1
you 1
ve 1
ever 1
been 1
engaged 1
to 1
The 1
child 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
Tom 1
said 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
cry 1
Becky 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
her 1
any 1
more 1
Yes 1
you 1
do 1
Tom 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
do 1
Tom 1
tried 1
to 1
put 1
his 1
arm 1
about 1
her 1
neck 1
but 1
she 1
pushed 1
him 1
away 1
and 1
turned 1
her 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
crying 1
Tom 1
tried 1
again 1
with 1
soothing 1
words 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
was 1
repulsed 1
again 1
Then 1
his 1
pride 1
was 1
up 1
and 1
he 1
strode 1
away 1
and 1
went 1
outside 1
He 1
stood 1
about 1
restless 1
and 1
uneasy 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
hoping 1
she 1
would 1
repent 1
and 1
come 1
to 1
find 1
him 1
But 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
Then 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
badly 1
and 1
fear 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
hard 1
struggle 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
make 1
new 1
advances 1
now 1
but 1
he 1
nerved 1
himself 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
entered 1
She 1
was 1
still 1
standing 1
back 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
sobbing 1
with 1
her 1
face 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
Tom 1
s 1
heart 1
smote 1
him 1
He 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
stood 1
a 1
moment 1
not 1
knowing 1
exactly 1
how 1
to 1
proceed 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
hesitatingly 1
Becky 1
I 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
anybody 1
but 1
you 1
No 1
reply 1
but 1
sobs 1
Becky 1
pleadingly 1
Becky 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
say 1
something 1
More 1
sobs 1
Tom 1
got 1
out 1
his 1
chiefest 1
jewel 1
a 1
brass 1
knob 1
from 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
an 1
andiron 1
and 1
passed 1
it 1
around 1
her 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
Please 1
Becky 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
take 1
it 1
She 1
struck 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
Then 1
Tom 1
marched 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
over 1
the 1
hills 1
and 1
far 1
away 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
school 1
no 1
more 1
that 1
day 1
Presently 1
Becky 1
began 1
to 1
suspect 1
She 1
ran 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
sight 1
she 1
flew 1
around 1
to 1
the 1
play 1
yard 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
Then 1
she 1
called 1
Tom 1
Come 1
back 1
Tom 1
She 1
listened 1
intently 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
answer 1
She 1
had 1
no 1
companions 1
but 1
silence 1
and 1
loneliness 1
So 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
cry 1
again 1
and 1
upbraid 1
herself 1
and 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
scholars 1
began 1
to 1
gather 1
again 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
hide 1
her 1
griefs 1
and 1
still 1
her 1
broken 1
heart 1
and 1
take 1
up 1
the 1
cross 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
dreary 1
aching 1
afternoon 1
with 1
none 1
among 1
the 1
strangers 1
about 1
her 1
to 1
exchange 1
sorrows 1
with 1
CHAPTER 1
VIII 1
TOM 1
dodged 1
hither 1
and 1
thither 1
through 1
lanes 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
well 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
track 1
of 1
returning 1
scholars 1
and 1
then 1
fell 1
into 1
a 1
moody 1
jog 1
He 1
crossed 1
a 1
small 1
branch 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
because 1
of 1
a 1
prevailing 1
juvenile 1
superstition 1
that 1
to 1
cross 1
water 1
baffled 1
pursuit 1
Half 1
an 1
hour 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
disappearing 1
behind 1
the 1
Douglas 1
mansion 1
on 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
and 1
the 1
school 1
house 1
was 1
hardly 1
distinguishable 1
away 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
valley 1
behind 1
him 1
He 1
entered 1
a 1
dense 1
wood 1
picked 1
his 1
pathless 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
a 1
mossy 1
spot 1
under 1
a 1
spreading 1
oak 1
There 1
was 1
not 1
even 1
a 1
zephyr 1
stirring 1
the 1
dead 1
noonday 1
heat 1
had 1
even 1
stilled 1
the 1
songs 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
nature 1
lay 1
in 1
a 1
trance 1
that 1
was 1
broken 1
by 1
no 1
sound 1
but 1
the 1
occasional 1
far 1
off 1
hammering 1
of 1
a 1
wood 1
pecker 1
and 1
this 1
seemed 1
to 1
render 1
the 1
pervading 1
silence 1
and 1
sense 1
of 1
loneliness 1
the 1
more 1
profound 1
The 1
boy 1
s 1
soul 1
was 1
steeped 1
in 1
melancholy 1
his 1
feelings 1
were 1
in 1
happy 1
accord 1
with 1
his 1
surroundings 1
He 1
sat 1
long 1
with 1
his 1
elbows 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
his 1
chin 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
meditating 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
life 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
trouble 1
at 1
best 1
and 1
he 1
more 1
than 1
half 1
envied 1
Jimmy 1
Hodges 1
so 1
lately 1
released 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
peaceful 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
lie 1
and 1
slumber 1
and 1
dream 1
forever 1
and 1
ever 1
with 1
the 1
wind 1
whispering 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
caressing 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
the 1
flowers 1
over 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
nothing 1
to 1
bother 1
and 1
grieve 1
about 1
ever 1
any 1
more 1
If 1
he 1
only 1
had 1
a 1
clean 1
Sunday 1
school 1
record 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
willing 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
be 1
done 1
with 1
it 1
all 1
Now 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
girl 1
What 1
had 1
he 1
done 1
Nothing 1
He 1
had 1
meant 1
the 1
best 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
been 1
treated 1
like 1
a 1
dog 1
like 1
a 1
very 1
dog 1
She 1
would 1
be 1
sorry 1
some 1
day 1
maybe 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
Ah 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
die 1
temporarily 1
But 1
the 1
elastic 1
heart 1
of 1
youth 1
cannot 1
be 1
compressed 1
into 1
one 1
constrained 1
shape 1
long 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
Tom 1
presently 1
began 1
to 1
drift 1
insensibly 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
concerns 1
of 1
this 1
life 1
again 1
What 1
if 1
he 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
now 1
and 1
disappeared 1
mysteriously 1
What 1
if 1
he 1
went 1
away 1
ever 1
so 1
far 1
away 1
into 1
unknown 1
countries 1
beyond 1
the 1
seas 1
and 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
any 1
more 1
How 1
would 1
she 1
feel 1
then 1
The 1
idea 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
clown 1
recurred 1
to 1
him 1
now 1
only 1
to 1
fill 1
him 1
with 1
disgust 1
For 1
frivolity 1
and 1
jokes 1
and 1
spotted 1
tights 1
were 1
an 1
offense 1
when 1
they 1
intruded 1
themselves 1
upon 1
a 1
spirit 1
that 1
was 1
exalted 1
into 1
the 1
vague 1
august 1
realm 1
of 1
the 1
romantic 1
No 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
soldier 1
and 1
return 1
after 1
long 1
years 1
all 1
war 1
worn 1
and 1
illustrious 1
No 1
better 1
still 1
he 1
would 1
join 1
the 1
Indians 1
and 1
hunt 1
buffaloes 1
and 1
go 1
on 1
the 1
warpath 1
in 1
the 1
mountain 1
ranges 1
and 1
the 1
trackless 1
great 1
plains 1
of 1
the 1
Far 1
West 1
and 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
come 1
back 1
a 1
great 1
chief 1
bristling 1
with 1
feathers 1
hideous 1
with 1
paint 1
and 1
prance 1
into 1
Sunday 1
school 1
some 1
drowsy 1
summer 1
morning 1
with 1
a 1
blood 1
curdling 1
war 1
whoop 1
and 1
sear 1
the 1
eyeballs 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
companions 1
with 1
unappeasable 1
envy 1
But 1
no 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
gaudier 1
even 1
than 1
this 1
He 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
pirate 1
That 1
was 1
it 1
now 1
his 1
future 1
lay 1
plain 1
before 1
him 1
and 1
glowing 1
with 1
unimaginable 1
splendor 1
How 1
his 1
name 1
would 1
fill 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
make 1
people 1
shudder 1
How 1
gloriously 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
plowing 1
the 1
dancing 1
seas 1
in 1
his 1
long 1
low 1
black 1
hulled 1
racer 1
the 1
Spirit 1
of 1
the 1
Storm 1
with 1
his 1
grisly 1
flag 1
flying 1
at 1
the 1
fore 1
And 1
at 1
the 1
zenith 1
of 1
his 1
fame 1
how 1
he 1
would 1
suddenly 1
appear 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
village 1
and 1
stalk 1
into 1
church 1
brown 1
and 1
weather 1
beaten 1
in 1
his 1
black 1
velvet 1
doublet 1
and 1
trunks 1
his 1
great 1
jack 1
boots 1
his 1
crimson 1
sash 1
his 1
belt 1
bristling 1
with 1
horse 1
pistols 1
his 1
crime 1
rusted 1
cutlass 1
at 1
his 1
side 1
his 1
slouch 1
hat 1
with 1
waving 1
plumes 1
his 1
black 1
flag 1
unfurled 1
with 1
the 1
skull 1
and 1
crossbones 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
hear 1
with 1
swelling 1
ecstasy 1
the 1
whisperings 1
It 1
s 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
the 1
Pirate 1
the 1
Black 1
Avenger 1
of 1
the 1
Spanish 1
Main 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
settled 1
his 1
career 1
was 1
determined 1
He 1
would 1
run 1
away 1
from 1
home 1
and 1
enter 1
upon 1
it 1
He 1
would 1
start 1
the 1
very 1
next 1
morning 1
Therefore 1
he 1
must 1
now 1
begin 1
to 1
get 1
ready 1
He 1
would 1
collect 1
his 1
resources 1
together 1
He 1
went 1
to 1
a 1
rotten 1
log 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
dig 1
under 1
one 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
Barlow 1
knife 1
He 1
soon 1
struck 1
wood 1
that 1
sounded 1
hollow 1
He 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
there 1
and 1
uttered 1
this 1
incantation 1
impressively 1
What 1
hasn 1
t 1
come 1
here 1
come 1
What 1
s 1
here 1
stay 1
here 1
Then 1
he 1
scraped 1
away 1
the 1
dirt 1
and 1
exposed 1
a 1
pine 1
shingle 1
He 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
disclosed 1
a 1
shapely 1
little 1
treasure 1
house 1
whose 1
bottom 1
and 1
sides 1
were 1
of 1
shingles 1
In 1
it 1
lay 1
a 1
marble 1
Tom 1
s 1
astonishment 1
was 1
bound 1
less 1
He 1
scratched 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
perplexed 1
air 1
and 1
said 1
Well 1
that 1
beats 1
anything 1
Then 1
he 1
tossed 1
the 1
marble 1
away 1
pettishly 1
and 1
stood 1
cogitating 1
The 1
truth 1
was 1
that 1
a 1
superstition 1
of 1
his 1
had 1
failed 1
here 1
which 1
he 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
comrades 1
had 1
always 1
looked 1
upon 1
as 1
infallible 1
If 1
you 1
buried 1
a 1
marble 1
with 1
certain 1
necessary 1
incantations 1
and 1
left 1
it 1
alone 1
a 1
fortnight 1
and 1
then 1
opened 1
the 1
place 1
with 1
the 1
incantation 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
used 1
you 1
would 1
find 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
marbles 1
you 1
had 1
ever 1
lost 1
had 1
gathered 1
themselves 1
together 1
there 1
meantime 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
widely 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
separated 1
But 1
now 1
this 1
thing 1
had 1
actually 1
and 1
unquestionably 1
failed 1
Tom 1
s 1
whole 1
structure 1
of 1
faith 1
was 1
shaken 1
to 1
its 1
foundations 1
He 1
had 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
heard 1
of 1
this 1
thing 1
succeeding 1
but 1
never 1
of 1
its 1
failing 1
before 1
It 1
did 1
not 1
occur 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
tried 1
it 1
several 1
times 1
before 1
himself 1
but 1
could 1
never 1
find 1
the 1
hiding 1
places 1
afterward 1
He 1
puzzled 1
over 1
the 1
matter 1
some 1
time 1
and 1
finally 1
decided 1
that 1
some 1
witch 1
had 1
interfered 1
and 1
broken 1
the 1
charm 1
He 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
satisfy 1
himself 1
on 1
that 1
point 1
so 1
he 1
searched 1
around 1
till 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
small 1
sandy 1
spot 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
funnel 1
shaped 1
depression 1
in 1
it 1
He 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
mouth 1
close 1
to 1
this 1
depression 1
and 1
called 1
Doodle 1
bug 1
doodle 1
bug 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
Doodle 1
bug 1
doodle 1
bug 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
The 1
sand 1
began 1
to 1
work 1
and 1
presently 1
a 1
small 1
black 1
bug 1
appeared 1
for 1
a 1
second 1
and 1
then 1
darted 1
under 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
fright 1
He 1
dasn 1
t 1
tell 1
So 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
witch 1
that 1
done 1
it 1
I 1
just 1
knowed 1
it 1
He 1
well 1
knew 1
the 1
futility 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
contend 1
against 1
witches 1
so 1
he 1
gave 1
up 1
discouraged 1
But 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
as 1
well 1
have 1
the 1
marble 1
he 1
had 1
just 1
thrown 1
away 1
and 1
therefore 1
he 1
went 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
patient 1
search 1
for 1
it 1
But 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
Now 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
treasure 1
house 1
and 1
carefully 1
placed 1
himself 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
standing 1
when 1
he 1
tossed 1
the 1
marble 1
away 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
another 1
marble 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
tossed 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
saying 1
Brother 1
go 1
find 1
your 1
brother 1
He 1
watched 1
where 1
it 1
stopped 1
and 1
went 1
there 1
and 1
looked 1
But 1
it 1
must 1
have 1
fallen 1
short 1
or 1
gone 1
too 1
far 1
so 1
he 1
tried 1
twice 1
more 1
The 1
last 1
repetition 1
was 1
successful 1
The 1
two 1
marbles 1
lay 1
within 1
a 1
foot 1
of 1
each 1
other 1
Just 1
here 1
the 1
blast 1
of 1
a 1
toy 1
tin 1
trumpet 1
came 1
faintly 1
down 1
the 1
green 1
aisles 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
Tom 1
flung 1
off 1
his 1
jacket 1
and 1
trousers 1
turned 1
a 1
suspender 1
into 1
a 1
belt 1
raked 1
away 1
some 1
brush 1
behind 1
the 1
rotten 1
log 1
disclosing 1
a 1
rude 1
bow 1
and 1
arrow 1
a 1
lath 1
sword 1
and 1
a 1
tin 1
trumpet 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
had 1
seized 1
these 1
things 1
and 1
bounded 1
away 1
barelegged 1
with 1
fluttering 1
shirt 1
He 1
presently 1
halted 1
under 1
a 1
great 1
elm 1
blew 1
an 1
answering 1
blast 1
and 1
then 1
began 1
to 1
tiptoe 1
and 1
look 1
warily 1
out 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
He 1
said 1
cautiously 1
to 1
an 1
imaginary 1
company 1
Hold 1
my 1
merry 1
men 1
Keep 1
hid 1
till 1
I 1
blow 1
Now 1
appeared 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
as 1
airily 1
clad 1
and 1
elaborately 1
armed 1
as 1
Tom 1
Tom 1
called 1
Hold 1
Who 1
comes 1
here 1
into 1
Sherwood 1
Forest 1
without 1
my 1
pass 1
Guy 1
of 1
Guisborne 1
wants 1
no 1
man 1
s 1
pass 1
Who 1
art 1
thou 1
that 1
that 1
Dares 1
to 1
hold 1
such 1
language 1
said 1
Tom 1
prompting 1
for 1
they 1
talked 1
by 1
the 1
book 1
from 1
memory 1
Who 1
art 1
thou 1
that 1
dares 1
to 1
hold 1
such 1
language 1
I 1
indeed 1
I 1
am 1
Robin 1
Hood 1
as 1
thy 1
caitiff 1
carcase 1
soon 1
shall 1
know 1
Then 1
art 1
thou 1
indeed 1
that 1
famous 1
outlaw 1
Right 1
gladly 1
will 1
I 1
dispute 1
with 1
thee 1
the 1
passes 1
of 1
the 1
merry 1
wood 1
Have 1
at 1
thee 1
They 1
took 1
their 1
lath 1
swords 1
dumped 1
their 1
other 1
traps 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
struck 1
a 1
fencing 1
attitude 1
foot 1
to 1
foot 1
and 1
began 1
a 1
grave 1
careful 1
combat 1
two 1
up 1
and 1
two 1
down 1
Presently 1
Tom 1
said 1
Now 1
if 1
you 1
ve 1
got 1
the 1
hang 1
go 1
it 1
lively 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
it 1
lively 1
panting 1
and 1
perspiring 1
with 1
the 1
work 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Tom 1
shouted 1
Fall 1
fall 1
Why 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
fall 1
I 1
sha 1
n 1
t 1
Why 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
fall 1
yourself 1
You 1
re 1
getting 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1
Why 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
anything 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
fall 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
book 1
The 1
book 1
says 1
Then 1
with 1
one 1
back 1
handed 1
stroke 1
he 1
slew 1
poor 1
Guy 1
of 1
Guisborne 1
You 1
re 1
to 1
turn 1
around 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
hit 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
getting 1
around 1
the 1
authorities 1
so 1
Joe 1
turned 1
received 1
the 1
whack 1
and 1
fell 1
Now 1
said 1
Joe 1
getting 1
up 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
kill 1
you 1
That 1
s 1
fair 1
Why 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
do 1
that 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
in 1
the 1
book 1
Well 1
it 1
s 1
blamed 1
mean 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
Well 1
say 1
Joe 1
you 1
can 1
be 1
Friar 1
Tuck 1
or 1
Much 1
the 1
miller 1
s 1
son 1
and 1
lam 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
quarter 1
staff 1
or 1
I 1
ll 1
be 1
the 1
Sheriff 1
of 1
Nottingham 1
and 1
you 1
be 1
Robin 1
Hood 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
and 1
kill 1
me 1
This 1
was 1
satisfactory 1
and 1
so 1
these 1
adventures 1
were 1
carried 1
out 1
Then 1
Tom 1
became 1
Robin 1
Hood 1
again 1
and 1
was 1
allowed 1
by 1
the 1
treacherous 1
nun 1
to 1
bleed 1
his 1
strength 1
away 1
through 1
his 1
neglected 1
wound 1
And 1
at 1
last 1
Joe 1
representing 1
a 1
whole 1
tribe 1
of 1
weeping 1
outlaws 1
dragged 1
him 1
sadly 1
forth 1
gave 1
his 1
bow 1
into 1
his 1
feeble 1
hands 1
and 1
Tom 1
said 1
Where 1
this 1
arrow 1
falls 1
there 1
bury 1
poor 1
Robin 1
Hood 1
under 1
the 1
greenwood 1
tree 1
Then 1
he 1
shot 1
the 1
arrow 1
and 1
fell 1
back 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
died 1
but 1
he 1
lit 1
on 1
a 1
nettle 1
and 1
sprang 1
up 1
too 1
gaily 1
for 1
a 1
corpse 1
The 1
boys 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
hid 1
their 1
accoutrements 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
grieving 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
outlaws 1
any 1
more 1
and 1
wondering 1
what 1
modern 1
civilization 1
could 1
claim 1
to 1
have 1
done 1
to 1
compensate 1
for 1
their 1
loss 1
They 1
said 1
they 1
would 1
rather 1
be 1
outlaws 1
a 1
year 1
in 1
Sherwood 1
Forest 1
than 1
President 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
forever 1
CHAPTER 1
IX 1
AT 1
half 1
past 1
nine 1
that 1
night 1
Tom 1
and 1
Sid 1
were 1
sent 1
to 1
bed 1
as 1
usual 1
They 1
said 1
their 1
prayers 1
and 1
Sid 1
was 1
soon 1
asleep 1
Tom 1
lay 1
awake 1
and 1
waited 1
in 1
restless 1
impatience 1
When 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
nearly 1
daylight 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
clock 1
strike 1
ten 1
This 1
was 1
despair 1
He 1
would 1
have 1
tossed 1
and 1
fidgeted 1
as 1
his 1
nerves 1
demanded 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
he 1
might 1
wake 1
Sid 1
So 1
he 1
lay 1
still 1
and 1
stared 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
dark 1
Everything 1
was 1
dismally 1
still 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
stillness 1
little 1
scarcely 1
perceptible 1
noises 1
began 1
to 1
emphasize 1
themselves 1
The 1
ticking 1
of 1
the 1
clock 1
began 1
to 1
bring 1
itself 1
into 1
notice 1
Old 1
beams 1
began 1
to 1
crack 1
mysteriously 1
The 1
stairs 1
creaked 1
faintly 1
Evidently 1
spirits 1
were 1
abroad 1
A 1
measured 1
muffled 1
snore 1
issued 1
from 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
chamber 1
And 1
now 1
the 1
tiresome 1
chirping 1
of 1
a 1
cricket 1
that 1
no 1
human 1
ingenuity 1
could 1
locate 1
began 1
Next 1
the 1
ghastly 1
ticking 1
of 1
a 1
death 1
watch 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
at 1
the 1
bed 1
s 1
head 1
made 1
Tom 1
shudder 1
it 1
meant 1
that 1
somebody 1
s 1
days 1
were 1
numbered 1
Then 1
the 1
howl 1
of 1
a 1
far 1
off 1
dog 1
rose 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
air 1
and 1
was 1
answered 1
by 1
a 1
fainter 1
howl 1
from 1
a 1
remoter 1
distance 1
Tom 1
was 1
in 1
an 1
agony 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
satisfied 1
that 1
time 1
had 1
ceased 1
and 1
eternity 1
begun 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
doze 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
the 1
clock 1
chimed 1
eleven 1
but 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
it 1
And 1
then 1
there 1
came 1
mingling 1
with 1
his 1
half 1
formed 1
dreams 1
a 1
most 1
melancholy 1
caterwauling 1
The 1
raising 1
of 1
a 1
neighboring 1
window 1
disturbed 1
him 1
A 1
cry 1
of 1
Scat 1
you 1
devil 1
and 1
the 1
crash 1
of 1
an 1
empty 1
bottle 1
against 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
woodshed 1
brought 1
him 1
wide 1
awake 1
and 1
a 1
single 1
minute 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
dressed 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
creeping 1
along 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
ell 1
on 1
all 1
fours 1
He 1
meow 1
d 1
with 1
caution 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
as 1
he 1
went 1
then 1
jumped 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
woodshed 1
and 1
thence 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
Huckleberry 1
Finn 1
was 1
there 1
with 1
his 1
dead 1
cat 1
The 1
boys 1
moved 1
off 1
and 1
disappeared 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
they 1
were 1
wading 1
through 1
the 1
tall 1
grass 1
of 1
the 1
graveyard 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
graveyard 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
fashioned 1
Western 1
kind 1
It 1
was 1
on 1
a 1
hill 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
It 1
had 1
a 1
crazy 1
board 1
fence 1
around 1
it 1
which 1
leaned 1
inward 1
in 1
places 1
and 1
outward 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
but 1
stood 1
upright 1
nowhere 1
Grass 1
and 1
weeds 1
grew 1
rank 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
cemetery 1
All 1
the 1
old 1
graves 1
were 1
sunken 1
in 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
tombstone 1
on 1
the 1
place 1
round 1
topped 1
worm 1
eaten 1
boards 1
staggered 1
over 1
the 1
graves 1
leaning 1
for 1
support 1
and 1
finding 1
none 1
Sacred 1
to 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
So 1
and 1
So 1
had 1
been 1
painted 1
on 1
them 1
once 1
but 1
it 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
have 1
been 1
read 1
on 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
now 1
even 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
light 1
A 1
faint 1
wind 1
moaned 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
Tom 1
feared 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
dead 1
complaining 1
at 1
being 1
disturbed 1
The 1
boys 1
talked 1
little 1
and 1
only 1
under 1
their 1
breath 1
for 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
the 1
pervading 1
solemnity 1
and 1
silence 1
oppressed 1
their 1
spirits 1
They 1
found 1
the 1
sharp 1
new 1
heap 1
they 1
were 1
seeking 1
and 1
ensconced 1
themselves 1
within 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
three 1
great 1
elms 1
that 1
grew 1
in 1
a 1
bunch 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
Then 1
they 1
waited 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
what 1
seemed 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
The 1
hooting 1
of 1
a 1
distant 1
owl 1
was 1
all 1
the 1
sound 1
that 1
troubled 1
the 1
dead 1
stillness 1
Tom 1
s 1
reflections 1
grew 1
oppressive 1
He 1
must 1
force 1
some 1
talk 1
So 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
whisper 1
Hucky 1
do 1
you 1
believe 1
the 1
dead 1
people 1
like 1
it 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
here 1
Huckleberry 1
whispered 1
I 1
wisht 1
I 1
knowed 1
It 1
s 1
awful 1
solemn 1
like 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
I 1
bet 1
it 1
is 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
considerable 1
pause 1
while 1
the 1
boys 1
canvassed 1
this 1
matter 1
inwardly 1
Then 1
Tom 1
whispered 1
Say 1
Hucky 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
Hoss 1
Williams 1
hears 1
us 1
talking 1
O 1
course 1
he 1
does 1
Least 1
his 1
sperrit 1
does 1
Tom 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
d 1
said 1
Mister 1
Williams 1
But 1
I 1
never 1
meant 1
any 1
harm 1
Everybody 1
calls 1
him 1
Hoss 1
A 1
body 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
too 1
partic 1
lar 1
how 1
they 1
talk 1
bout 1
these 1
yer 1
dead 1
people 1
Tom 1
This 1
was 1
a 1
damper 1
and 1
conversation 1
died 1
again 1
Presently 1
Tom 1
seized 1
his 1
comrade 1
s 1
arm 1
and 1
said 1
Sh 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
Tom 1
And 1
the 1
two 1
clung 1
together 1
with 1
beating 1
hearts 1
Sh 1
There 1
tis 1
again 1
Didn 1
t 1

There 1
Now 1

I 1

Tom 1
but 1
Lord 1
I 1
m 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
shiver 1
Listen 1
The 1
boys 1
bent 1
their 1
heads 1
together 1
and 1
scarcely 1
breathed 1
A 1
muffled 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
floated 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
graveyard 1
Look 1
See 1
there 1
whispered 1
Tom 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
It 1
s 1
devil 1
fire 1
Oh 1
Tom 1
this 1
is 1
awful 1
Some 1
vague 1
figures 1
approached 1
through 1
the 1
gloom 1
swinging 1
an 1
old 1
fashioned 1
tin 1
lantern 1
that 1
freckled 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
innumerable 1
little 1
spangles 1
of 1
light 1
Presently 1
Huckleberry 1
whispered 1
with 1
a 1
shudder 1
It 1
s 1

devils 1

Three 1

a 1
dern 1
sight 1
What 1
kin 1
they 1
be 1
up 1
to 1
The 1
whisper 1
died 1
wholly 1
out 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
three 1
men 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
stood 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
hiding 1
place 1
Here 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
the 1
third 1
voice 1
and 1
the 1
owner 1
of 1
it 1
held 1
the 1
lantern 1
up 1
and 1
revealed 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
young 1
Doctor 1
Robinson 1
Potter 1
and 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
were 1
carrying 1
a 1
handbarrow 1
with 1
a 1
rope 1
and 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
shovels 1
on 1
it 1
They 1
cast 1
down 1
their 1
load 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
grave 1
The 1
doctor 1
put 1
the 1
lantern 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
and 1
came 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
with 1
his 1
back 1
against 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
elm 1
trees 1
He 1
was 1
so 1
close 1
the 1
boys 1
could 1
have 1
touched 1
him 1
Hurry 1
men 1
he 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
the 1
moon 1
might 1
come 1
out 1
at 1
any 1
moment 1
They 1
growled 1
a 1
response 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
digging 1
For 1
some 1
time 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
noise 1
but 1
the 1
grating 1
sound 1
of 1
the 1
spades 1
discharging 1
their 1
freight 1
of 1
mould 1
and 1
gravel 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
monotonous 1
Finally 1
a 1
spade 1
struck 1
upon 1
the 1
coffin 1
with 1
a 1
dull 1
woody 1
accent 1
and 1
within 1
another 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
the 1
men 1
had 1
hoisted 1
it 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
They 1
pried 1
off 1
the 1
lid 1
with 1
their 1
shovels 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
dumped 1
it 1
rudely 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
The 1
moon 1
drifted 1
from 1
behind 1
the 1
clouds 1
and 1
exposed 1
the 1
pallid 1
face 1
The 1
barrow 1
was 1
got 1
ready 1
and 1
the 1
corpse 1
placed 1
on 1
it 1
covered 1
with 1
a 1
blanket 1
and 1
bound 1
to 1
its 1
place 1
with 1
the 1
rope 1
Potter 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
large 1
spring 1
knife 1
and 1
cut 1
off 1
the 1
dangling 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
rope 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
Now 1
the 1
cussed 1
thing 1
s 1
ready 1
Sawbones 1
and 1
you 1
ll 1
just 1
out 1
with 1
another 1
five 1
or 1
here 1
she 1
stays 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
talk 1
said 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
Look 1
here 1
what 1
does 1
this 1
mean 1
said 1
the 1
doctor 1
You 1
required 1
your 1
pay 1
in 1
advance 1
and 1
I 1
ve 1
paid 1
you 1
Yes 1
and 1
you 1
done 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
said 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
approaching 1
the 1
doctor 1
who 1
was 1
now 1
standing 1
Five 1
years 1
ago 1
you 1
drove 1
me 1
away 1
from 1
your 1
father 1
s 1
kitchen 1
one 1
night 1
when 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
ask 1
for 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
you 1
said 1
I 1
warn 1
t 1
there 1
for 1
any 1
good 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
swore 1
I 1
d 1
get 1
even 1
with 1
you 1
if 1
it 1
took 1
a 1
hundred 1
years 1
your 1
father 1
had 1
me 1
jailed 1
for 1
a 1
vagrant 1
Did 1
you 1
think 1
I 1
d 1
forget 1
The 1
Injun 1
blood 1
ain 1
t 1
in 1
me 1
for 1
nothing 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
settle 1
you 1
know 1
He 1
was 1
threatening 1
the 1
doctor 1
with 1
his 1
fist 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
The 1
doctor 1
struck 1
out 1
suddenly 1
and 1
stretched 1
the 1
ruffian 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
Potter 1
dropped 1
his 1
knife 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
Here 1
now 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
hit 1
my 1
pard 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
moment 1
he 1
had 1
grappled 1
with 1
the 1
doctor 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
were 1
struggling 1
with 1
might 1
and 1
main 1
trampling 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
tearing 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
their 1
heels 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
his 1
eyes 1
flaming 1
with 1
passion 1
snatched 1
up 1
Potter 1
s 1
knife 1
and 1
went 1
creeping 1
catlike 1
and 1
stooping 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
about 1
the 1
combatants 1
seeking 1
an 1
opportunity 1
All 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
doctor 1
flung 1
himself 1
free 1
seized 1
the 1
heavy 1
headboard 1
of 1
Williams 1
grave 1
and 1
felled 1
Potter 1
to 1
the 1
earth 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
the 1
half 1
breed 1
saw 1
his 1
chance 1
and 1
drove 1
the 1
knife 1
to 1
the 1
hilt 1
in 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
s 1
breast 1
He 1
reeled 1
and 1
fell 1
partly 1
upon 1
Potter 1
flooding 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
blood 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
moment 1
the 1
clouds 1
blotted 1
out 1
the 1
dreadful 1
spectacle 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
frightened 1
boys 1
went 1
speeding 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
Presently 1
when 1
the 1
moon 1
emerged 1
again 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
was 1
standing 1
over 1
the 1
two 1
forms 1
contemplating 1
them 1
The 1
doctor 1
murmured 1
inarticulately 1
gave 1
a 1
long 1
gasp 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
The 1
half 1
breed 1
muttered 1
That 1
score 1
is 1
settled 1
damn 1
you 1
Then 1
he 1
robbed 1
the 1
body 1
After 1
which 1
he 1
put 1
the 1
fatal 1
knife 1
in 1
Potter 1
s 1
open 1
right 1
hand 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
dismantled 1
coffin 1
Three 1
four 1
five 1
minutes 1
passed 1
and 1
then 1
Potter 1
began 1
to 1
stir 1
and 1
moan 1
His 1
hand 1
closed 1
upon 1
the 1
knife 1
he 1
raised 1
it 1
glanced 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
let 1
it 1
fall 1
with 1
a 1
shudder 1
Then 1
he 1
sat 1
up 1
pushing 1
the 1
body 1
from 1
him 1
and 1
gazed 1
at 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
around 1
him 1
confusedly 1
His 1
eyes 1
met 1
Joe 1
s 1
Lord 1
how 1
is 1
this 1
Joe 1
he 1
said 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
dirty 1
business 1
said 1
Joe 1
without 1
moving 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
it 1
for 1
I 1
I 1
never 1
done 1
it 1
Look 1
here 1
That 1
kind 1
of 1
talk 1
won 1
t 1
wash 1
Potter 1
trembled 1
and 1
grew 1
white 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
d 1
got 1
sober 1
I 1
d 1
no 1
business 1
to 1
drink 1
to 1
night 1
But 1
it 1
s 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
yet 1
worse 1
n 1
when 1
we 1
started 1
here 1
I 1
m 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
muddle 1
can 1
t 1
recollect 1
anything 1
of 1
it 1
hardly 1
Tell 1
me 1
Joe 1
honest 1
now 1
old 1
feller 1
did 1
I 1
do 1
it 1
Joe 1
I 1
never 1
meant 1
to 1
pon 1
my 1
soul 1
and 1
honor 1
I 1
never 1
meant 1
to 1
Joe 1
Tell 1
me 1
how 1
it 1
was 1
Joe 1
Oh 1
it 1
s 1
awful 1
and 1
him 1
so 1
young 1
and 1
promising 1
Why 1
you 1
two 1
was 1
scuffling 1
and 1
he 1
fetched 1
you 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
headboard 1
and 1
you 1
fell 1
flat 1
and 1
then 1
up 1
you 1
come 1
all 1
reeling 1
and 1
staggering 1
like 1
and 1
snatched 1
the 1
knife 1
and 1
jammed 1
it 1
into 1
him 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
fetched 1
you 1
another 1
awful 1
clip 1
and 1
here 1
you 1
ve 1
laid 1
as 1
dead 1
as 1
a 1
wedge 1
til 1
now 1
Oh 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
doing 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
may 1
die 1
this 1
minute 1
if 1
I 1
did 1
It 1
was 1
all 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
whiskey 1
and 1
the 1
excitement 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
never 1
used 1
a 1
weepon 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
before 1
Joe 1
I 1
ve 1
fought 1
but 1
never 1
with 1
weepons 1
They 1
ll 1
all 1
say 1
that 1
Joe 1
don 1
t 1
tell 1
Say 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
tell 1
Joe 1
that 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
feller 1
I 1
always 1
liked 1
you 1
Joe 1
and 1
stood 1
up 1
for 1
you 1
too 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
remember 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
tell 1
will 1
you 1
Joe 1
And 1
the 1
poor 1
creature 1
dropped 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
before 1
the 1
stolid 1
murderer 1
and 1
clasped 1
his 1
appealing 1
hands 1
No 1
you 1
ve 1
always 1
been 1
fair 1
and 1
square 1
with 1
me 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
and 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
go 1
back 1
on 1
you 1
There 1
now 1
that 1
s 1
as 1
fair 1
as 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
say 1
Oh 1
Joe 1
you 1
re 1
an 1
angel 1
I 1
ll 1
bless 1
you 1
for 1
this 1
the 1
longest 1
day 1
I 1
live 1
And 1
Potter 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
Come 1
now 1
that 1
s 1
enough 1
of 1
that 1
This 1
ain 1
t 1
any 1
time 1
for 1
blubbering 1
You 1
be 1
off 1
yonder 1
way 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
go 1
this 1
Move 1
now 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
leave 1
any 1
tracks 1
behind 1
you 1
Potter 1
started 1
on 1
a 1
trot 1
that 1
quickly 1
increased 1
to 1
a 1
run 1
The 1
half 1
breed 1
stood 1
looking 1
after 1
him 1
He 1
muttered 1
If 1
he 1
s 1
as 1
much 1
stunned 1
with 1
the 1
lick 1
and 1
fuddled 1
with 1
the 1
rum 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
being 1
he 1
won 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
knife 1
till 1
he 1
s 1
gone 1
so 1
far 1
he 1
ll 1
be 1
afraid 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
after 1
it 1
to 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
by 1
himself 1
chicken 1
heart 1
Two 1
or 1
three 1
minutes 1
later 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
the 1
blanketed 1
corpse 1
the 1
lidless 1
coffin 1
and 1
the 1
open 1
grave 1
were 1
under 1
no 1
inspection 1
but 1
the 1
moon 1
s 1
The 1
stillness 1
was 1
complete 1
again 1
too 1
CHAPTER 1
X 1
THE 1
two 1
boys 1
flew 1
on 1
and 1
on 1
toward 1
the 1
village 1
speechless 1
with 1
horror 1
They 1
glanced 1
backward 1
over 1
their 1
shoulders 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
apprehensively 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
feared 1
they 1
might 1
be 1
followed 1
Every 1
stump 1
that 1
started 1
up 1
in 1
their 1
path 1
seemed 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
an 1
enemy 1
and 1
made 1
them 1
catch 1
their 1
breath 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
sped 1
by 1
some 1
outlying 1
cottages 1
that 1
lay 1
near 1
the 1
village 1
the 1
barking 1
of 1
the 1
aroused 1
watch 1
dogs 1
seemed 1
to 1
give 1
wings 1
to 1
their 1
feet 1
If 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
tannery 1
before 1
we 1
break 1
down 1
whispered 1
Tom 1
in 1
short 1
catches 1
between 1
breaths 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
stand 1
it 1
much 1
longer 1
Huckleberry 1
s 1
hard 1
pantings 1
were 1
his 1
only 1
reply 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
fixed 1
their 1
eyes 1
on 1
the 1
goal 1
of 1
their 1
hopes 1
and 1
bent 1
to 1
their 1
work 1
to 1
win 1
it 1
They 1
gained 1
steadily 1
on 1
it 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
breast 1
to 1
breast 1
they 1
burst 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
door 1
and 1
fell 1
grateful 1
and 1
exhausted 1
in 1
the 1
sheltering 1
shadows 1
beyond 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
their 1
pulses 1
slowed 1
down 1
and 1
Tom 1
whispered 1
Huckleberry 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
reckon 1
ll 1
come 1
of 1
this 1
If 1
Doctor 1
Robinson 1
dies 1
I 1
reckon 1
hanging 1
ll 1
come 1
of 1
it 1
Do 1
you 1
though 1
Why 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
Tom 1
Tom 1
thought 1
a 1
while 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
Who 1
ll 1
tell 1
We 1
What 1
are 1
you 1
talking 1
about 1
S 1
pose 1
something 1
happened 1
and 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
didn 1
t 1
hang 1
Why 1
he 1
d 1
kill 1
us 1
some 1
time 1
or 1
other 1
just 1
as 1
dead 1
sure 1
as 1
we 1
re 1
a 1
laying 1
here 1
That 1
s 1
just 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
to 1
myself 1
Huck 1
If 1
anybody 1
tells 1
let 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
do 1
it 1
if 1
he 1
s 1
fool 1
enough 1
He 1
s 1
generally 1
drunk 1
enough 1
Tom 1
said 1
nothing 1
went 1
on 1
thinking 1
Presently 1
he 1
whispered 1
Huck 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
it 1
How 1
can 1
he 1
tell 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
reason 1
he 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
it 1
Because 1
he 1
d 1
just 1
got 1
that 1
whack 1
when 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
done 1
it 1
D 1
you 1
reckon 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
anything 1
D 1
you 1
reckon 1
he 1
knowed 1
anything 1
By 1
hokey 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
Tom 1
And 1
besides 1
look 1
a 1
here 1
maybe 1
that 1
whack 1
done 1
for 1
him 1
No 1
taint 1
likely 1
Tom 1
He 1
had 1
liquor 1
in 1
him 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
and 1
besides 1
he 1
always 1
has 1
Well 1
when 1
pap 1
s 1
full 1
you 1
might 1
take 1
and 1
belt 1
him 1
over 1
the 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
church 1
and 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
phase 1
him 1
He 1
says 1
so 1
his 1
own 1
self 1
So 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
of 1
course 1
But 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
was 1
dead 1
sober 1
I 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
that 1
whack 1
might 1
fetch 1
him 1
I 1
dono 1
After 1
another 1
reflective 1
silence 1
Tom 1
said 1
Hucky 1
you 1
sure 1
you 1
can 1
keep 1
mum 1
Tom 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
keep 1
mum 1
You 1
know 1
that 1
That 1
Injun 1
devil 1
wouldn 1
t 1
make 1
any 1
more 1
of 1
drownding 1
us 1
than 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
cats 1
if 1
we 1
was 1
to 1
squeak 1
bout 1
this 1
and 1
they 1
didn 1
t 1
hang 1
him 1
Now 1
look 1
a 1
here 1
Tom 1
less 1
take 1
and 1
swear 1
to 1
one 1
another 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
swear 1
to 1
keep 1
mum 1
I 1
m 1
agreed 1
It 1
s 1
the 1
best 1
thing 1
Would 1
you 1
just 1
hold 1
hands 1
and 1
swear 1
that 1
we 1
Oh 1
no 1
that 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
for 1
this 1
That 1
s 1
good 1
enough 1
for 1
little 1
rubbishy 1
common 1
things 1
specially 1
with 1
gals 1
cuz 1
they 1
go 1
back 1
on 1
you 1
anyway 1
and 1
blab 1
if 1
they 1
get 1
in 1
a 1
huff 1
but 1
there 1
orter 1
be 1
writing 1
bout 1
a 1
big 1
thing 1
like 1
this 1
And 1
blood 1
Tom 1
s 1
whole 1
being 1
applauded 1
this 1
idea 1
It 1
was 1
deep 1
and 1
dark 1
and 1
awful 1
the 1
hour 1
the 1
circumstances 1
the 1
surroundings 1
were 1
in 1
keeping 1
with 1
it 1
He 1
picked 1
up 1
a 1
clean 1
pine 1
shingle 1
that 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
moon 1
light 1
took 1
a 1
little 1
fragment 1
of 1
red 1
keel 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
got 1
the 1
moon 1
on 1
his 1
work 1
and 1
painfully 1
scrawled 1
these 1
lines 1
emphasizing 1
each 1
slow 1
down 1
stroke 1
by 1
clamping 1
his 1
tongue 1
between 1
his 1
teeth 1
and 1
letting 1
up 1
the 1
pressure 1
on 1
the 1
up 1
strokes 1
See 1
next 1
page 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
and 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
swears 1
they 1
will 1
keep 1
mum 1
about 1
This 1
and 1
They 1
wish 1
They 1
may 1
Drop 1
down 1
dead 1
in 1
Their 1
Tracks 1
if 1
They 1
ever 1
Tell 1
and 1
Rot 1
Huckleberry 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
admiration 1
of 1
Tom 1
s 1
facility 1
in 1
writing 1
and 1
the 1
sublimity 1
of 1
his 1
language 1
He 1
at 1
once 1
took 1
a 1
pin 1
from 1
his 1
lapel 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
prick 1
his 1
flesh 1
but 1
Tom 1
said 1
Hold 1
on 1
Don 1
t 1
do 1
that 1
A 1
pin 1
s 1
brass 1
It 1
might 1
have 1
verdigrease 1
on 1
it 1
What 1
s 1
verdigrease 1
It 1
s 1
p 1
ison 1
That 1
s 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
You 1
just 1
swaller 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
once 1
you 1
ll 1
see 1
So 1
Tom 1
unwound 1
the 1
thread 1
from 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
needles 1
and 1
each 1
boy 1
pricked 1
the 1
ball 1
of 1
his 1
thumb 1
and 1
squeezed 1
out 1
a 1
drop 1
of 1
blood 1
In 1
time 1
after 1
many 1
squeezes 1
Tom 1
managed 1
to 1
sign 1
his 1
initials 1
using 1
the 1
ball 1
of 1
his 1
little 1
finger 1
for 1
a 1
pen 1
Then 1
he 1
showed 1
Huckleberry 1
how 1
to 1
make 1
an 1
H 1
and 1
an 1
F 1
and 1
the 1
oath 1
was 1
complete 1
They 1
buried 1
the 1
shingle 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
some 1
dismal 1
ceremonies 1
and 1
incantations 1
and 1
the 1
fetters 1
that 1
bound 1
their 1
tongues 1
were 1
considered 1
to 1
be 1
locked 1
and 1
the 1
key 1
thrown 1
away 1
A 1
figure 1
crept 1
stealthily 1
through 1
a 1
break 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
ruined 1
building 1
now 1
but 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
notice 1
it 1
Tom 1
whispered 1
Huckleberry 1
does 1
this 1
keep 1
us 1
from 1
ever 1
telling 1
always 1
Of 1
course 1
it 1
does 1
It 1
don 1
t 1
make 1
any 1
difference 1
what 1
happens 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
keep 1
mum 1
We 1
d 1
drop 1
down 1
dead 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
Yes 1
I 1
reckon 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
They 1
continued 1
to 1
whisper 1
for 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
Presently 1
a 1
dog 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
long 1
lugubrious 1
howl 1
just 1
outside 1
within 1
ten 1
feet 1
of 1
them 1
The 1
boys 1
clasped 1
each 1
other 1
suddenly 1
in 1
an 1
agony 1
of 1
fright 1
Which 1
of 1
us 1
does 1
he 1
mean 1
gasped 1
Huckleberry 1
I 1
dono 1
peep 1
through 1
the 1
crack 1
Quick 1
No 1
you 1
Tom 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
Huck 1
Please 1
Tom 1
There 1
tis 1
again 1
Oh 1
lordy 1
I 1
m 1
thankful 1
whispered 1
Tom 1
I 1
know 1
his 1
voice 1
It 1
s 1
Bull 1
Harbison 1
If 1
Mr 1
Harbison 1
owned 1
a 1
slave 1
named 1
Bull 1
Tom 1
would 1
have 1
spoken 1
of 1
him 1
as 1
Harbison 1
s 1
Bull 1
but 1
a 1
son 1
or 1
a 1
dog 1
of 1
that 1
name 1
was 1
Bull 1
Harbison 1
Oh 1
that 1
s 1
good 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
Tom 1
I 1
was 1
most 1
scared 1
to 1
death 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
bet 1
anything 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
stray 1
dog 1
The 1
dog 1
howled 1
again 1
The 1
boys 1
hearts 1
sank 1
once 1
more 1
Oh 1
my 1
that 1
ain 1

Bull 1
Harbison 1
whispered 1
Huckleberry 1
Do 1
Tom 1
Tom 1
quaking 1
with 1
fear 1
yielded 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
eye 1
to 1
the 1
crack 1
His 1
whisper 1
was 1
hardly 1
audible 1
when 1
he 1
said 1
Oh 1
Huck 1
its 1
a 1
stray 1
dog 1
Quick 1
Tom 1
quick 1
Who 1
does 1
he 1
mean 1
Huck 1

must 1
mean 1

Oh 1

and 1

Sid 1
if 1
I 1

a 1
tried 1
but 1
no 1
I 1
wouldn 1

of 1
course 1
But 1
if 1
ever 1

off 1
this 1
time 1
I 1
lay 1
I 1
ll 1
just 1
waller 1
in 1
Sunday 1
schools 1
And 1
Tom 1
began 1
to 1
snuffle 1
a 1
little 1
You 1
bad 1
and 1
Huckleberry 1
began 1
to 1
snuffle 1
too 1
Consound 1

Tom 1
Sawyer 1

re 1
just 1
old 1
pie 1

o 1

Oh 1
lordy 1
lordy 1
lordy 1
I 1
wisht 1
I 1
only 1
had 1
half 1
your 1
chance 1
Tom 1
choked 1
off 1
and 1
whispered 1
Look 1
Hucky 1
look 1
He 1
s 1
got 1
his 1
back 1
to 1
us 1
Hucky 1
looked 1
with 1
joy 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
Well 1
he 1
has 1
by 1
jingoes 1
Did 1
he 1
before 1
Yes 1
he 1
did 1
But 1
I 1
like 1
a 1
fool 1
never 1
thought 1
Oh 1
this 1
is 1
bully 1
you 1
know 1
Now 1
who 1
can 1
he 1
mean 1
The 1
howling 1
stopped 1
Tom 1
pricked 1
up 1
his 1
ears 1
Sh 1
What 1
s 1
that 1
he 1
whispered 1
Sounds 1
like 1
like 1
hogs 1
grunting 1
No 1
it 1
s 1
somebody 1
snoring 1
Tom 1
That 1
is 1
it 1
Where 1
bouts 1
is 1
it 1
Huck 1
I 1
bleeve 1
it 1
s 1
down 1
at 1
tother 1
end 1
Sounds 1
so 1
anyway 1
Pap 1
used 1
to 1
sleep 1
there 1
sometimes 1
long 1
with 1
the 1
hogs 1
but 1
laws 1
bless 1
you 1
he 1
just 1
lifts 1
things 1
when 1
he 1
snores 1
Besides 1
I 1
reckon 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
ever 1
coming 1
back 1
to 1
this 1
town 1
any 1
more 1
The 1
spirit 1
of 1
adventure 1
rose 1
in 1
the 1
boys 1
souls 1
once 1
more 1
Hucky 1
do 1
you 1
das 1
t 1
to 1
go 1
if 1
I 1
lead 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
much 1
Tom 1
s 1
pose 1
it 1
s 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
Tom 1
quailed 1
But 1
presently 1
the 1
temptation 1
rose 1
up 1
strong 1
again 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
agreed 1
to 1
try 1
with 1
the 1
understanding 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
to 1
their 1
heels 1
if 1
the 1
snoring 1
stopped 1
So 1
they 1
went 1
tiptoeing 1
stealthily 1
down 1
the 1
one 1
behind 1
the 1
other 1
When 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
to 1
within 1
five 1
steps 1
of 1
the 1
snorer 1
Tom 1
stepped 1
on 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
it 1
broke 1
with 1
a 1
sharp 1
snap 1
The 1
man 1
moaned 1
writhed 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
moonlight 1
It 1
was 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
The 1
boys 1
hearts 1
had 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
their 1
hopes 1
too 1
when 1
the 1
man 1
moved 1
but 1
their 1
fears 1
passed 1
away 1
now 1
They 1
tip 1
toed 1
out 1
through 1
the 1
broken 1
weather 1
boarding 1
and 1
stopped 1
at 1
a 1
little 1
distance 1
to 1
exchange 1
a 1
parting 1
word 1
That 1
long 1
lugubrious 1
howl 1
rose 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
air 1
again 1
They 1
turned 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
strange 1
dog 1
standing 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
of 1
where 1
Potter 1
was 1
lying 1
and 1
facing 1
Potter 1
with 1
his 1
nose 1
pointing 1
heavenward 1
Oh 1
geeminy 1
it 1
s 1
him 1
exclaimed 1
both 1
boys 1
in 1
a 1
breath 1
Say 1
Tom 1
they 1
say 1
a 1
stray 1
dog 1
come 1
howling 1
around 1
Johnny 1
Miller 1
s 1
house 1
bout 1
midnight 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
two 1
weeks 1
ago 1
and 1
a 1
whippoorwill 1
come 1
in 1
and 1
lit 1
on 1
the 1
banisters 1
and 1
sung 1
the 1
very 1
same 1
evening 1
and 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
anybody 1
dead 1
there 1
yet 1
Well 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
And 1
suppose 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
Didn 1
t 1
Gracie 1
Miller 1
fall 1
in 1
the 1
kitchen 1
fire 1
and 1
burn 1
herself 1
terrible 1
the 1
very 1
next 1
Saturday 1
Yes 1
but 1
she 1
ain 1
t 1
dead 1
And 1
what 1
s 1
more 1
she 1
s 1
getting 1
better 1
too 1
All 1
right 1
you 1
wait 1
and 1
see 1
She 1
s 1
a 1
goner 1
just 1
as 1
dead 1
sure 1
as 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
s 1
a 1
goner 1
That 1
s 1
what 1
the 1
niggers 1
say 1
and 1
they 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
these 1
kind 1
of 1
things 1
Huck 1
Then 1
they 1
separated 1
cogitating 1
When 1
Tom 1
crept 1
in 1
at 1
his 1
bedroom 1
window 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
almost 1
spent 1
He 1
undressed 1
with 1
excessive 1
caution 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
congratulating 1
himself 1
that 1
nobody 1
knew 1
of 1
his 1
escapade 1
He 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
that 1
the 1
gently 1
snoring 1
Sid 1
was 1
awake 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
for 1
an 1
hour 1
When 1
Tom 1
awoke 1
Sid 1
was 1
dressed 1
and 1
gone 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
late 1
look 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
a 1
late 1
sense 1
in 1
the 1
atmosphere 1
He 1
was 1
startled 1
Why 1
had 1
he 1
not 1
been 1
called 1
persecuted 1
till 1
he 1
was 1
up 1
as 1
usual 1
The 1
thought 1
filled 1
him 1
with 1
bodings 1
Within 1
five 1
minutes 1
he 1
was 1
dressed 1
and 1
down 1
stairs 1
feeling 1
sore 1
and 1
drowsy 1
The 1
family 1
were 1
still 1
at 1
table 1
but 1
they 1
had 1
finished 1
breakfast 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
voice 1
of 1
rebuke 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
averted 1
eyes 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
silence 1
and 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
solemnity 1
that 1
struck 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
the 1
culprit 1
s 1
heart 1
He 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
seem 1
gay 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
up 1
hill 1
work 1
it 1
roused 1
no 1
smile 1
no 1
response 1
and 1
he 1
lapsed 1
into 1
silence 1
and 1
let 1
his 1
heart 1
sink 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
depths 1
After 1
breakfast 1
his 1
aunt 1
took 1
him 1
aside 1
and 1
Tom 1
almost 1
brightened 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
flogged 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
His 1
aunt 1
wept 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
and 1
break 1
her 1
old 1
heart 1
so 1
and 1
finally 1
told 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
and 1
ruin 1
himself 1
and 1
bring 1
her 1
gray 1
hairs 1
with 1
sorrow 1
to 1
the 1
grave 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
use 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
try 1
any 1
more 1
This 1
was 1
worse 1
than 1
a 1
thousand 1
whippings 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
heart 1
was 1
sorer 1
now 1
than 1
his 1
body 1
He 1
cried 1
he 1
pleaded 1
for 1
forgiveness 1
promised 1
to 1
reform 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
received 1
his 1
dismissal 1
feeling 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
won 1
but 1
an 1
imperfect 1
forgiveness 1
and 1
established 1
but 1
a 1
feeble 1
confidence 1
He 1
left 1
the 1
presence 1
too 1
miserable 1
to 1
even 1
feel 1
revengeful 1
toward 1
Sid 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
latter 1
s 1
prompt 1
retreat 1
through 1
the 1
back 1
gate 1
was 1
unnecessary 1
He 1
moped 1
to 1
school 1
gloomy 1
and 1
sad 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
flogging 1
along 1
with 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
for 1
playing 1
hookey 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
one 1
whose 1
heart 1
was 1
busy 1
with 1
heavier 1
woes 1
and 1
wholly 1
dead 1
to 1
trifles 1
Then 1
he 1
betook 1
himself 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
rested 1
his 1
elbows 1
on 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
his 1
jaws 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
stared 1
at 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
the 1
stony 1
stare 1
of 1
suffering 1
that 1
has 1
reached 1
the 1
limit 1
and 1
can 1
no 1
further 1
go 1
His 1
elbow 1
was 1
pressing 1
against 1
some 1
hard 1
substance 1
After 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
he 1
slowly 1
and 1
sadly 1
changed 1
his 1
position 1
and 1
took 1
up 1
this 1
object 1
with 1
a 1
sigh 1
It 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
paper 1
He 1
unrolled 1
it 1
A 1
long 1
lingering 1
colossal 1
sigh 1
followed 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
broke 1
It 1
was 1
his 1
brass 1
andiron 1
knob 1
This 1
final 1
feather 1
broke 1
the 1
camel 1
s 1
back 1
CHAPTER 1
XI 1
CLOSE 1
upon 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
noon 1
the 1
whole 1
village 1
was 1
suddenly 1
electrified 1
with 1
the 1
ghastly 1
news 1
No 1
need 1
of 1
the 1
as 1
yet 1
un 1
dreamed 1
of 1
telegraph 1
the 1
tale 1
flew 1
from 1
man 1
to 1
man 1
from 1
group 1
to 1
group 1
from 1
house 1
to 1
house 1
with 1
little 1
less 1
than 1
telegraphic 1
speed 1
Of 1
course 1
the 1
schoolmaster 1
gave 1
holi 1
day 1
for 1
that 1
afternoon 1
the 1
town 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
strangely 1
of 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
A 1
gory 1
knife 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
and 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
recognized 1
by 1
somebody 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
so 1
the 1
story 1
ran 1
And 1
it 1
was 1
said 1
that 1
a 1
belated 1
citizen 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
Potter 1
washing 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
branch 1
about 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
that 1
Potter 1
had 1
at 1
once 1
sneaked 1
off 1
suspicious 1
circumstances 1
especially 1
the 1
washing 1
which 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
habit 1
with 1
Potter 1
It 1
was 1
also 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
town 1
had 1
been 1
ransacked 1
for 1
this 1
murderer 1
the 1
public 1
are 1
not 1
slow 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
sifting 1
evidence 1
and 1
arriving 1
at 1
a 1
verdict 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
found 1
Horsemen 1
had 1
departed 1
down 1
all 1
the 1
roads 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
and 1
the 1
Sheriff 1
was 1
confident 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
captured 1
before 1
night 1
All 1
the 1
town 1
was 1
drifting 1
toward 1
the 1
graveyard 1
Tom 1
s 1
heartbreak 1
vanished 1
and 1
he 1
joined 1
the 1
procession 1
not 1
because 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
a 1
thousand 1
times 1
rather 1
go 1
anywhere 1
else 1
but 1
because 1
an 1
awful 1
unaccountable 1
fascination 1
drew 1
him 1
on 1
Arrived 1
at 1
the 1
dreadful 1
place 1
he 1
wormed 1
his 1
small 1
body 1
through 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
dismal 1
spectacle 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
an 1
age 1
since 1
he 1
was 1
there 1
before 1
Somebody 1
pinched 1
his 1
arm 1
He 1
turned 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
met 1
Huckleberry 1
s 1
Then 1
both 1
looked 1
elsewhere 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
wondered 1
if 1
anybody 1
had 1
noticed 1
anything 1
in 1
their 1
mutual 1
glance 1
But 1
everybody 1
was 1
talking 1
and 1
intent 1
upon 1
the 1
grisly 1
spectacle 1
before 1
them 1
Poor 1
fellow 1
Poor 1
young 1
fellow 1
This 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
lesson 1
to 1
grave 1
robbers 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
ll 1
hang 1
for 1
this 1
if 1
they 1
catch 1
him 1
This 1
was 1
the 1
drift 1
of 1
remark 1
and 1
the 1
minister 1
said 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
judgment 1
His 1
hand 1
is 1
here 1
Now 1
Tom 1
shivered 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
heel 1
for 1
his 1
eye 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
stolid 1
face 1
of 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
At 1
this 1
moment 1
the 1
crowd 1
began 1
to 1
sway 1
and 1
struggle 1
and 1
voices 1
shouted 1
It 1
s 1
him 1
it 1
s 1
him 1
he 1
s 1
coming 1
himself 1
Who 1
Who 1
from 1
twenty 1
voices 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
Hallo 1
he 1
s 1
stopped 1
Look 1
out 1
he 1
s 1
turning 1
Don 1
t 1
let 1
him 1
get 1
away 1
People 1
in 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
over 1
Tom 1
s 1
head 1
said 1
he 1
wasn 1
t 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
he 1
only 1
looked 1
doubtful 1
and 1
perplexed 1
Infernal 1
impudence 1
said 1
a 1
bystander 1
wanted 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
take 1
a 1
quiet 1
look 1
at 1
his 1
work 1
I 1
reckon 1
didn 1
t 1
expect 1
any 1
company 1
The 1
crowd 1
fell 1
apart 1
now 1
and 1
the 1
Sheriff 1
came 1
through 1
ostentatiously 1
leading 1
Potter 1
by 1
the 1
arm 1
The 1
poor 1
fellow 1
s 1
face 1
was 1
haggard 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
showed 1
the 1
fear 1
that 1
was 1
upon 1
him 1
When 1
he 1
stood 1
before 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
he 1
shook 1
as 1
with 1
a 1
palsy 1
and 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
friends 1
he 1
sobbed 1
pon 1
my 1
word 1
and 1
honor 1
I 1
never 1
done 1
it 1
Who 1
s 1
accused 1
you 1
shouted 1
a 1
voice 1
This 1
shot 1
seemed 1
to 1
carry 1
home 1
Potter 1
lifted 1
his 1
face 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
pathetic 1
hopelessness 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
He 1
saw 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
Oh 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
you 1
promised 1
me 1
you 1
d 1
never 1
Is 1
that 1
your 1
knife 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
thrust 1
before 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
Sheriff 1
Potter 1
would 1
have 1
fallen 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
caught 1
him 1
and 1
eased 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
Something 1
told 1
me 1
t 1
if 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
get 1
He 1
shuddered 1
then 1
waved 1
his 1
nerveless 1
hand 1
with 1
a 1
vanquished 1
gesture 1
and 1
said 1
Tell 1
em 1
Joe 1
tell 1
em 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
any 1
use 1
any 1
more 1
Then 1
Huckleberry 1
and 1
Tom 1
stood 1
dumb 1
and 1
staring 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
stony 1
hearted 1
liar 1
reel 1
off 1
his 1
serene 1
statement 1
they 1
expecting 1
every 1
moment 1
that 1
the 1
clear 1
sky 1
would 1
deliver 1
God 1
s 1
lightnings 1
upon 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
wondering 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
long 1
the 1
stroke 1
was 1
delayed 1
And 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
and 1
still 1
stood 1
alive 1
and 1
whole 1
their 1
wavering 1
impulse 1
to 1
break 1
their 1
oath 1
and 1
save 1
the 1
poor 1
betrayed 1
prisoner 1
s 1
life 1
faded 1
and 1
vanished 1
away 1
for 1
plainly 1
this 1
miscreant 1
had 1
sold 1
himself 1
to 1
Satan 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
fatal 1
to 1
meddle 1
with 1
the 1
property 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
power 1
as 1
that 1
Why 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
leave 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
come 1
here 1
for 1
somebody 1
said 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
help 1
it 1
Potter 1
moaned 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
come 1
anywhere 1
but 1
here 1
And 1
he 1
fell 1
to 1
sobbing 1
again 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
repeated 1
his 1
statement 1
just 1
as 1
calmly 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
afterward 1
on 1
the 1
inquest 1
under 1
oath 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
seeing 1
that 1
the 1
lightnings 1
were 1
still 1
withheld 1
were 1
confirmed 1
in 1
their 1
belief 1
that 1
Joe 1
had 1
sold 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
devil 1
He 1
was 1
now 1
become 1
to 1
them 1
the 1
most 1
balefully 1
interesting 1
object 1
they 1
had 1
ever 1
looked 1
upon 1
and 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
their 1
fascinated 1
eyes 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
They 1
inwardly 1
resolved 1
to 1
watch 1
him 1
nights 1
when 1
opportunity 1
should 1
offer 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
getting 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
his 1
dread 1
master 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
helped 1
to 1
raise 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
murdered 1
man 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
wagon 1
for 1
removal 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
whispered 1
through 1
the 1
shuddering 1
crowd 1
that 1
the 1
wound 1
bled 1
a 1
little 1
The 1
boys 1
thought 1
that 1
this 1
happy 1
circumstance 1
would 1
turn 1
suspicion 1
in 1
the 1
right 1
direction 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
disappointed 1
for 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
villager 1
remarked 1
It 1
was 1
within 1
three 1
feet 1
of 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
when 1
it 1
done 1
it 1
Tom 1
s 1
fearful 1
secret 1
and 1
gnawing 1
conscience 1
disturbed 1
his 1
sleep 1
for 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
a 1
week 1
after 1
this 1
and 1
at 1
breakfast 1
one 1
morning 1
Sid 1
said 1
Tom 1
you 1
pitch 1
around 1
and 1
talk 1
in 1
your 1
sleep 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
you 1
keep 1
me 1
awake 1
half 1
the 1
time 1
Tom 1
blanched 1
and 1
dropped 1
his 1
eyes 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
bad 1
sign 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
gravely 1
What 1
you 1
got 1
on 1
your 1
mind 1
Tom 1
Nothing 1
Nothing 1
t 1
I 1
know 1
of 1
But 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
hand 1
shook 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
spilled 1
his 1
coffee 1
And 1
you 1
do 1
talk 1
such 1
stuff 1
Sid 1
said 1
Last 1
night 1
you 1
said 1
It 1
s 1
blood 1
it 1
s 1
blood 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
You 1
said 1
that 1
over 1
and 1
over 1
And 1
you 1
said 1
Don 1
t 1
torment 1
me 1
so 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
Tell 1
what 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
you 1
ll 1
tell 1
Everything 1
was 1
swimming 1
before 1
Tom 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
telling 1
what 1
might 1
have 1
happened 1
now 1
but 1
luckily 1
the 1
concern 1
passed 1
out 1
of 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
face 1
and 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
Tom 1
s 1
relief 1
without 1
knowing 1
it 1
She 1
said 1
Sho 1
It 1
s 1
that 1
dreadful 1
murder 1
I 1
dream 1
about 1
it 1
most 1
every 1
night 1
myself 1
Sometimes 1
I 1
dream 1
it 1
s 1
me 1
that 1
done 1
it 1
Mary 1
said 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
affected 1
much 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
Sid 1
seemed 1
satisfied 1
Tom 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
presence 1
as 1
quick 1
as 1
he 1
plausibly 1
could 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
he 1
complained 1
of 1
toothache 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
tied 1
up 1
his 1
jaws 1
every 1
night 1
He 1
never 1
knew 1
that 1
Sid 1
lay 1
nightly 1
watching 1
and 1
frequently 1
slipped 1
the 1
bandage 1
free 1
and 1
then 1
leaned 1
on 1
his 1
elbow 1
listening 1
a 1
good 1
while 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
afterward 1
slipped 1
the 1
bandage 1
back 1
to 1
its 1
place 1
again 1
Tom 1
s 1
distress 1
of 1
mind 1
wore 1
off 1
gradually 1
and 1
the 1
toothache 1
grew 1
irksome 1
and 1
was 1
discarded 1
If 1
Sid 1
really 1
managed 1
to 1
make 1
anything 1
out 1
of 1
Tom 1
s 1
disjointed 1
mutterings 1
he 1
kept 1
it 1
to 1
himself 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
Tom 1
that 1
his 1
schoolmates 1
never 1
would 1
get 1
done 1
holding 1
inquests 1
on 1
dead 1
cats 1
and 1
thus 1
keeping 1
his 1
trouble 1
present 1
to 1
his 1
mind 1
Sid 1
noticed 1
that 1
Tom 1
never 1
was 1
coroner 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
inquiries 1
though 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
habit 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
lead 1
in 1
all 1
new 1
enterprises 1
he 1
noticed 1
too 1
that 1
Tom 1
never 1
acted 1
as 1
a 1
witness 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
strange 1
and 1
Sid 1
did 1
not 1
overlook 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
Tom 1
even 1
showed 1
a 1
marked 1
aversion 1
to 1
these 1
inquests 1
and 1
always 1
avoided 1
them 1
when 1
he 1
could 1
Sid 1
marvelled 1
but 1
said 1
nothing 1
However 1
even 1
inquests 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
vogue 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
ceased 1
to 1
torture 1
Tom 1
s 1
conscience 1
Every 1
day 1
or 1
two 1
during 1
this 1
time 1
of 1
sorrow 1
Tom 1
watched 1
his 1
opportunity 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
little 1
grated 1
jail 1
window 1
and 1
smuggled 1
such 1
small 1
comforts 1
through 1
to 1
the 1
murderer 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
The 1
jail 1
was 1
a 1
trifling 1
little 1
brick 1
den 1
that 1
stood 1
in 1
a 1
marsh 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
no 1
guards 1
were 1
afforded 1
for 1
it 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
seldom 1
occupied 1
These 1
offerings 1
greatly 1
helped 1
to 1
ease 1
Tom 1
s 1
conscience 1
The 1
villagers 1
had 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
to 1
tar 1
and 1
feather 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
and 1
ride 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
rail 1
for 1
body 1
snatching 1
but 1
so 1
formidable 1
was 1
his 1
character 1
that 1
nobody 1
could 1
be 1
found 1
who 1
was 1
willing 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
lead 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
dropped 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
careful 1
to 1
begin 1
both 1
of 1
his 1
inquest 1
statements 1
with 1
the 1
fight 1
without 1
confessing 1
the 1
grave 1
robbery 1
that 1
preceded 1
it 1
therefore 1
it 1
was 1
deemed 1
wisest 1
not 1
to 1
try 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
the 1
courts 1
at 1
present 1
CHAPTER 1
XII 1
ONE 1
of 1
the 1
reasons 1
why 1
Tom 1
s 1
mind 1
had 1
drifted 1
away 1
from 1
its 1
secret 1
troubles 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
new 1
and 1
weighty 1
matter 1
to 1
interest 1
itself 1
about 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
had 1
stopped 1
coming 1
to 1
school 1
Tom 1
had 1
struggled 1
with 1
his 1
pride 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
whistle 1
her 1
down 1
the 1
wind 1
but 1
failed 1
He 1
began 1
to 1
find 1
himself 1
hanging 1
around 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
nights 1
and 1
feeling 1
very 1
miserable 1
She 1
was 1
ill 1
What 1
if 1
she 1
should 1
die 1
There 1
was 1
distraction 1
in 1
the 1
thought 1
He 1
no 1
longer 1
took 1
an 1
interest 1
in 1
war 1
nor 1
even 1
in 1
piracy 1
The 1
charm 1
of 1
life 1
was 1
gone 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
but 1
dreariness 1
left 1
He 1
put 1
his 1
hoop 1
away 1
and 1
his 1
bat 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
joy 1
in 1
them 1
any 1
more 1
His 1
aunt 1
was 1
concerned 1
She 1
began 1
to 1
try 1
all 1
manner 1
of 1
remedies 1
on 1
him 1
She 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
infatuated 1
with 1
patent 1
medicines 1
and 1
all 1
new 1
fangled 1
methods 1
of 1
producing 1
health 1
or 1
mending 1
it 1
She 1
was 1
an 1
inveterate 1
experimenter 1
in 1
these 1
things 1
When 1
something 1
fresh 1
in 1
this 1
line 1
came 1
out 1
she 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
fever 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
not 1
on 1
herself 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
never 1
ailing 1
but 1
on 1
anybody 1
else 1
that 1
came 1
handy 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
subscriber 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
Health 1
periodicals 1
and 1
phrenological 1
frauds 1
and 1
the 1
solemn 1
ignorance 1
they 1
were 1
inflated 1
with 1
was 1
breath 1
to 1
her 1
nostrils 1
All 1
the 1
rot 1
they 1
contained 1
about 1
ventilation 1
and 1
how 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
how 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
what 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
what 1
to 1
drink 1
and 1
how 1
much 1
exercise 1
to 1
take 1
and 1
what 1
frame 1
of 1
mind 1
to 1
keep 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
in 1
and 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
clothing 1
to 1
wear 1
was 1
all 1
gospel 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
never 1
observed 1
that 1
her 1
health 1
journals 1
of 1
the 1
current 1
month 1
customarily 1
upset 1
everything 1
they 1
had 1
recommended 1
the 1
month 1
before 1
She 1
was 1
as 1
simple 1
hearted 1
and 1
honest 1
as 1
the 1
day 1
was 1
long 1
and 1
so 1
she 1
was 1
an 1
easy 1
victim 1
She 1
gathered 1
together 1
her 1
quack 1
periodicals 1
and 1
her 1
quack 1
medicines 1
and 1
thus 1
armed 1
with 1
death 1
went 1
about 1
on 1
her 1
pale 1
horse 1
metaphorically 1
speaking 1
with 1
hell 1
following 1
after 1
But 1
she 1
never 1
suspected 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
an 1
angel 1
of 1
healing 1
and 1
the 1
balm 1
of 1
Gilead 1
in 1
disguise 1
to 1
the 1
suffering 1
neighbors 1
The 1
water 1
treatment 1
was 1
new 1
now 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
low 1
condition 1
was 1
a 1
windfall 1
to 1
her 1
She 1
had 1
him 1
out 1
at 1
daylight 1
every 1
morning 1
stood 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
wood 1
shed 1
and 1
drowned 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
deluge 1
of 1
cold 1
water 1
then 1
she 1
scrubbed 1
him 1
down 1
with 1
a 1
towel 1
like 1
a 1
file 1
and 1
so 1
brought 1
him 1
to 1
then 1
she 1
rolled 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
wet 1
sheet 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
away 1
under 1
blankets 1
till 1
she 1
sweated 1
his 1
soul 1
clean 1
and 1
the 1
yellow 1
stains 1
of 1
it 1
came 1
through 1
his 1
pores 1
as 1
Tom 1
said 1
Yet 1
notwithstanding 1
all 1
this 1
the 1
boy 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
melancholy 1
and 1
pale 1
and 1
dejected 1
She 1
added 1
hot 1
baths 1
sitz 1
baths 1
shower 1
baths 1
and 1
plunges 1
The 1
boy 1
remained 1
as 1
dismal 1
as 1
a 1
hearse 1
She 1
began 1
to 1
assist 1
the 1
water 1
with 1
a 1
slim 1
oatmeal 1
diet 1
and 1
blister 1
plasters 1
She 1
calculated 1
his 1
capacity 1
as 1
she 1
would 1
a 1
jug 1
s 1
and 1
filled 1
him 1
up 1
every 1
day 1
with 1
quack 1
cure 1
alls 1
Tom 1
had 1
become 1
indifferent 1
to 1
persecution 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
This 1
phase 1
filled 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
s 1
heart 1
with 1
consternation 1
This 1
indifference 1
must 1
be 1
broken 1
up 1
at 1
any 1
cost 1
Now 1
she 1
heard 1
of 1
Pain 1
killer 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
She 1
ordered 1
a 1
lot 1
at 1
once 1
She 1
tasted 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
gratitude 1
It 1
was 1
simply 1
fire 1
in 1
a 1
liquid 1
form 1
She 1
dropped 1
the 1
water 1
treatment 1
and 1
everything 1
else 1
and 1
pinned 1
her 1
faith 1
to 1
Pain 1
killer 1
She 1
gave 1
Tom 1
a 1
teaspoonful 1
and 1
watched 1
with 1
the 1
deepest 1
anxiety 1
for 1
the 1
result 1
Her 1
troubles 1
were 1
instantly 1
at 1
rest 1
her 1
soul 1
at 1
peace 1
again 1
for 1
the 1
indifference 1
was 1
broken 1
up 1
The 1
boy 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
shown 1
a 1
wilder 1
heartier 1
interest 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
built 1
a 1
fire 1
under 1
him 1
Tom 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
wake 1
up 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
life 1
might 1
be 1
romantic 1
enough 1
in 1
his 1
blighted 1
condition 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
getting 1
to 1
have 1
too 1
little 1
sentiment 1
and 1
too 1
much 1
distracting 1
variety 1
about 1
it 1
So 1
he 1
thought 1
over 1
various 1
plans 1
for 1
relief 1
and 1
finally 1
hit 1
upon 1
that 1
of 1
professing 1
to 1
be 1
fond 1
of 1
Pain 1
killer 1
He 1
asked 1
for 1
it 1
so 1
often 1
that 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
nuisance 1
and 1
his 1
aunt 1
ended 1
by 1
telling 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
himself 1
and 1
quit 1
bothering 1
her 1
If 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
Sid 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
no 1
misgivings 1
to 1
alloy 1
her 1
delight 1
but 1
since 1
it 1
was 1
Tom 1
she 1
watched 1
the 1
bottle 1
clandestinely 1
She 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
medicine 1
did 1
really 1
diminish 1
but 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
occur 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
mending 1
the 1
health 1
of 1
a 1
crack 1
in 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
floor 1
with 1
it 1
One 1
day 1
Tom 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
dosing 1
the 1
crack 1
when 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
yellow 1
cat 1
came 1
along 1
purring 1
eyeing 1
the 1
teaspoon 1
avariciously 1
and 1
begging 1
for 1
a 1
taste 1
Tom 1
said 1
Don 1
t 1
ask 1
for 1
it 1
unless 1
you 1
want 1
it 1
Peter 1
But 1
Peter 1
signified 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
want 1
it 1
You 1
better 1
make 1
sure 1
Peter 1
was 1
sure 1
Now 1
you 1
ve 1
asked 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
give 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
because 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
anything 1
mean 1
about 1
me 1
but 1
if 1
you 1
find 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
it 1
you 1
mustn 1
t 1
blame 1
anybody 1
but 1
your 1
own 1
self 1
Peter 1
was 1
agreeable 1
So 1
Tom 1
pried 1
his 1
mouth 1
open 1
and 1
poured 1
down 1
the 1
Pain 1
killer 1
Peter 1
sprang 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
yards 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
then 1
delivered 1
a 1
war 1
whoop 1
and 1
set 1
off 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
room 1
banging 1
against 1
furniture 1
upsetting 1
flower 1
pots 1
and 1
making 1
general 1
havoc 1
Next 1
he 1
rose 1
on 1
his 1
hind 1
feet 1
and 1
pranced 1
around 1
in 1
a 1
frenzy 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
with 1
his 1
head 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
his 1
voice 1
proclaiming 1
his 1
unappeasable 1
happiness 1
Then 1
he 1
went 1
tearing 1
around 1
the 1
house 1
again 1
spreading 1
chaos 1
and 1
destruction 1
in 1
his 1
path 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
entered 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
throw 1
a 1
few 1
double 1
summersets 1
deliver 1
a 1
final 1
mighty 1
hurrah 1
and 1
sail 1
through 1
the 1
open 1
window 1
carrying 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
flower 1
pots 1
with 1
him 1
The 1
old 1
lady 1
stood 1
petrified 1
with 1
astonishment 1
peering 1
over 1
her 1
glasses 1
Tom 1
lay 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
expiring 1
with 1
laughter 1
Tom 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
ails 1
that 1
cat 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
aunt 1
gasped 1
the 1
boy 1
Why 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
anything 1
like 1
it 1
What 1
did 1
make 1
him 1
act 1
so 1
Deed 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
cats 1
always 1
act 1
so 1
when 1
they 1
re 1
having 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
They 1
do 1
do 1
they 1
There 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
the 1
tone 1
that 1
made 1
Tom 1
apprehensive 1
Yes 1
m 1
That 1
is 1
I 1
believe 1
they 1
do 1
You 1
do 1
Yes 1
m 1
The 1
old 1
lady 1
was 1
bending 1
down 1
Tom 1
watching 1
with 1
interest 1
emphasized 1
by 1
anxiety 1
Too 1
late 1
he 1
divined 1
her 1
drift 1
The 1
handle 1
of 1
the 1
telltale 1
tea 1
spoon 1
was 1
visible 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
valance 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
took 1
it 1
held 1
it 1
up 1
Tom 1
winced 1
and 1
dropped 1
his 1
eyes 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
raised 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
usual 1
handle 1
his 1
ear 1
and 1
cracked 1
his 1
head 1
soundly 1
with 1
her 1
thimble 1
Now 1
sir 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
treat 1
that 1
poor 1
dumb 1
beast 1
so 1
for 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
pity 1
for 1
him 1
because 1
he 1
hadn 1
t 1
any 1
aunt 1
Hadn 1
t 1
any 1
aunt 1
you 1
numskull 1
What 1
has 1
that 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
Heaps 1
Because 1
if 1
he 1
d 1
had 1
one 1
she 1
d 1
a 1
burnt 1
him 1
out 1
herself 1
She 1
d 1
a 1
roasted 1
his 1
bowels 1
out 1
of 1
him 1
thout 1
any 1
more 1
feeling 1
than 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
human 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
felt 1
a 1
sudden 1
pang 1
of 1
remorse 1
This 1
was 1
putting 1
the 1
thing 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
light 1
what 1
was 1
cruelty 1
to 1
a 1
cat 1
might 1
be 1
cruelty 1
to 1
a 1
boy 1
too 1
She 1
began 1
to 1
soften 1
she 1
felt 1
sorry 1
Her 1
eyes 1
watered 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
she 1
put 1
her 1
hand 1
on 1
Tom 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
said 1
gently 1
I 1
was 1
meaning 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
Tom 1
And 1
Tom 1
it 1
did 1
do 1
you 1
good 1
Tom 1
looked 1
up 1
in 1
her 1
face 1
with 1
just 1
a 1
perceptible 1
twinkle 1
peeping 1
through 1
his 1
gravity 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
was 1
meaning 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
aunty 1
and 1
so 1
was 1
I 1
with 1
Peter 1
It 1
done 1
him 1
good 1
too 1
I 1
never 1
see 1
him 1
get 1
around 1
so 1
since 1
Oh 1
go 1
long 1
with 1
you 1
Tom 1
before 1
you 1
aggravate 1
me 1
again 1
And 1
you 1
try 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
boy 1
for 1
once 1
and 1
you 1
needn 1
t 1
take 1
any 1
more 1
medicine 1
Tom 1
reached 1
school 1
ahead 1
of 1
time 1
It 1
was 1
noticed 1
that 1
this 1
strange 1
thing 1
had 1
been 1
occurring 1
every 1
day 1
latterly 1
And 1
now 1
as 1
usual 1
of 1
late 1
he 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
the 1
schoolyard 1
instead 1
of 1
playing 1
with 1
his 1
comrades 1
He 1
was 1
sick 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
he 1
looked 1
it 1
He 1
tried 1
to 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
looking 1
everywhere 1
but 1
whither 1
he 1
really 1
was 1
looking 1
down 1
the 1
road 1
Presently 1
Jeff 1
Thatcher 1
hove 1
in 1
sight 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
face 1
lighted 1
he 1
gazed 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
sorrowfully 1
away 1
When 1
Jeff 1
arrived 1
Tom 1
accosted 1
him 1
and 1
led 1
up 1
warily 1
to 1
opportunities 1
for 1
remark 1
about 1
Becky 1
but 1
the 1
giddy 1
lad 1
never 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
bait 1
Tom 1
watched 1
and 1
watched 1
hoping 1
whenever 1
a 1
frisking 1
frock 1
came 1
in 1
sight 1
and 1
hating 1
the 1
owner 1
of 1
it 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
saw 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
right 1
one 1
At 1
last 1
frocks 1
ceased 1
to 1
appear 1
and 1
he 1
dropped 1
hopelessly 1
into 1
the 1
dumps 1
he 1
entered 1
the 1
empty 1
schoolhouse 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
suffer 1
Then 1
one 1
more 1
frock 1
passed 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
heart 1
gave 1
a 1
great 1
bound 1
The 1
next 1
instant 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
and 1
going 1
on 1
like 1
an 1
Indian 1
yelling 1
laughing 1
chasing 1
boys 1
jumping 1
over 1
the 1
fence 1
at 1
risk 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
limb 1
throwing 1
handsprings 1
standing 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
doing 1
all 1
the 1
heroic 1
things 1
he 1
could 1
conceive 1
of 1
and 1
keeping 1
a 1
furtive 1
eye 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
while 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
was 1
noticing 1
But 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
unconscious 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
she 1
never 1
looked 1
Could 1
it 1
be 1
possible 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
there 1
He 1
carried 1
his 1
exploits 1
to 1
her 1
immediate 1
vicinity 1
came 1
war 1
whooping 1
around 1
snatched 1
a 1
boy 1
s 1
cap 1
hurled 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
broke 1
through 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
boys 1
tumbling 1
them 1
in 1
every 1
direction 1
and 1
fell 1
sprawling 1
himself 1
under 1
Becky 1
s 1
nose 1
almost 1
upsetting 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
turned 1
with 1
her 1
nose 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
he 1
heard 1
her 1
say 1
Mf 1
some 1
people 1
think 1
they 1
re 1
mighty 1
smart 1
always 1
showing 1
off 1
Tom 1
s 1
cheeks 1
burned 1
He 1
gathered 1
himself 1
up 1
and 1
sneaked 1
off 1
crushed 1
and 1
crestfallen 1
CHAPTER 1
XIII 1
TOM 1
S 1
mind 1
was 1
made 1
up 1
now 1
He 1
was 1
gloomy 1
and 1
desperate 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
forsaken 1
friendless 1
boy 1
he 1
said 1
nobody 1
loved 1
him 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
out 1
what 1
they 1
had 1
driven 1
him 1
to 1
perhaps 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
sorry 1
he 1
had 1
tried 1
to 1
do 1
right 1
and 1
get 1
along 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
him 1
since 1
nothing 1
would 1
do 1
them 1
but 1
to 1
be 1
rid 1
of 1
him 1
let 1
it 1
be 1
so 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
blame 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
consequences 1
why 1
shouldn 1
t 1
they 1
What 1
right 1
had 1
the 1
friendless 1
to 1
complain 1
Yes 1
they 1
had 1
forced 1
him 1
to 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
would 1
lead 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
crime 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
choice 1
By 1
this 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
far 1
down 1
Meadow 1
Lane 1
and 1
the 1
bell 1
for 1
school 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
tinkled 1
faintly 1
upon 1
his 1
ear 1
He 1
sobbed 1
now 1
to 1
think 1
he 1
should 1
never 1
never 1
hear 1
that 1
old 1
familiar 1
sound 1
any 1
more 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
hard 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
forced 1
on 1
him 1
since 1
he 1
was 1
driven 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
cold 1
world 1
he 1
must 1
submit 1
but 1
he 1
forgave 1
them 1
Then 1
the 1
sobs 1
came 1
thick 1
and 1
fast 1
Just 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
he 1
met 1
his 1
soul 1
s 1
sworn 1
comrade 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
hard 1
eyed 1
and 1
with 1
evidently 1
a 1
great 1
and 1
dismal 1
purpose 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
Plainly 1
here 1
were 1
two 1
souls 1
with 1
but 1
a 1
single 1
thought 1
Tom 1
wiping 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
his 1
sleeve 1
began 1
to 1
blubber 1
out 1
something 1
about 1
a 1
resolution 1
to 1
escape 1
from 1
hard 1
usage 1
and 1
lack 1
of 1
sympathy 1
at 1
home 1
by 1
roaming 1
abroad 1
into 1
the 1
great 1
world 1
never 1
to 1
return 1
and 1
ended 1
by 1
hoping 1
that 1
Joe 1
would 1
not 1
forget 1
him 1
But 1
it 1
transpired 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
request 1
which 1
Joe 1
had 1
just 1
been 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
of 1
Tom 1
and 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
hunt 1
him 1
up 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
His 1
mother 1
had 1
whipped 1
him 1
for 1
drinking 1
some 1
cream 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
tasted 1
and 1
knew 1
nothing 1
about 1
it 1
was 1
plain 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
tired 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
wished 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
if 1
she 1
felt 1
that 1
way 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
but 1
succumb 1
he 1
hoped 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
happy 1
and 1
never 1
regret 1
having 1
driven 1
her 1
poor 1
boy 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
unfeeling 1
world 1
to 1
suffer 1
and 1
die 1
As 1
the 1
two 1
boys 1
walked 1
sorrowing 1
along 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
new 1
compact 1
to 1
stand 1
by 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
be 1
brothers 1
and 1
never 1
separate 1
till 1
death 1
relieved 1
them 1
of 1
their 1
troubles 1
Then 1
they 1
began 1
to 1
lay 1
their 1
plans 1
Joe 1
was 1
for 1
being 1
a 1
hermit 1
and 1
living 1
on 1
crusts 1
in 1
a 1
remote 1
cave 1
and 1
dying 1
some 1
time 1
of 1
cold 1
and 1
want 1
and 1
grief 1
but 1
after 1
listening 1
to 1
Tom 1
he 1
conceded 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
some 1
conspicuous 1
advantages 1
about 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
crime 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
consented 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
pirate 1
Three 1
miles 1
below 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
at 1
a 1
point 1
where 1
the 1
Mississippi 1
River 1
was 1
a 1
trifle 1
over 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
narrow 1
wooded 1
island 1
with 1
a 1
shallow 1
bar 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
this 1
offered 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
rendezvous 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
inhabited 1
it 1
lay 1
far 1
over 1
toward 1
the 1
further 1
shore 1
abreast 1
a 1
dense 1
and 1
almost 1
wholly 1
unpeopled 1
forest 1
So 1
Jackson 1
s 1
Island 1
was 1
chosen 1
Who 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
subjects 1
of 1
their 1
piracies 1
was 1
a 1
matter 1
that 1
did 1
not 1
occur 1
to 1
them 1
Then 1
they 1
hunted 1
up 1
Huckleberry 1
Finn 1
and 1
he 1
joined 1
them 1
promptly 1
for 1
all 1
careers 1
were 1
one 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
was 1
indifferent 1
They 1
presently 1
separated 1
to 1
meet 1
at 1
a 1
lonely 1
spot 1
on 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
two 1
miles 1
above 1
the 1
village 1
at 1
the 1
favorite 1
hour 1
which 1
was 1
midnight 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
log 1
raft 1
there 1
which 1
they 1
meant 1
to 1
capture 1
Each 1
would 1
bring 1
hooks 1
and 1
lines 1
and 1
such 1
provision 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
steal 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
dark 1
and 1
mysterious 1
way 1
as 1
became 1
outlaws 1
And 1
before 1
the 1
afternoon 1
was 1
done 1
they 1
had 1
all 1
managed 1
to 1
enjoy 1
the 1
sweet 1
glory 1
of 1
spreading 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
pretty 1
soon 1
the 1
town 1
would 1
hear 1
something 1
All 1
who 1
got 1
this 1
vague 1
hint 1
were 1
cautioned 1
to 1
be 1
mum 1
and 1
wait 1
About 1
midnight 1
Tom 1
arrived 1
with 1
a 1
boiled 1
ham 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
trifles 1
and 1
stopped 1
in 1
a 1
dense 1
undergrowth 1
on 1
a 1
small 1
bluff 1
overlooking 1
the 1
meeting 1
place 1
It 1
was 1
starlight 1
and 1
very 1
still 1
The 1
mighty 1
river 1
lay 1
like 1
an 1
ocean 1
at 1
rest 1
Tom 1
listened 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
no 1
sound 1
disturbed 1
the 1
quiet 1
Then 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
low 1
distinct 1
whistle 1
It 1
was 1
answered 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
bluff 1
Tom 1
whistled 1
twice 1
more 1
these 1
signals 1
were 1
answered 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
Then 1
a 1
guarded 1
voice 1
said 1
Who 1
goes 1
there 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
the 1
Black 1
Avenger 1
of 1
the 1
Spanish 1
Main 1
Name 1
your 1
names 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
the 1
Red 1
Handed 1
and 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
the 1
Terror 1
of 1
the 1
Seas 1
Tom 1
had 1
furnished 1
these 1
titles 1
from 1
his 1
favorite 1
literature 1
Tis 1
well 1
Give 1
the 1
countersign 1
Two 1
hoarse 1
whispers 1
delivered 1
the 1
same 1
awful 1
word 1
simultaneously 1
to 1
the 1
brooding 1
night 1
Blood 1
Then 1
Tom 1
tumbled 1
his 1
ham 1
over 1
the 1
bluff 1
and 1
let 1
himself 1
down 1
after 1
it 1
tearing 1
both 1
skin 1
and 1
clothes 1
to 1
some 1
extent 1
in 1
the 1
effort 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
easy 1
comfortable 1
path 1
along 1
the 1
shore 1
under 1
the 1
bluff 1
but 1
it 1
lacked 1
the 1
advantages 1
of 1
difficulty 1
and 1
danger 1
so 1
valued 1
by 1
a 1
pirate 1
The 1
Terror 1
of 1
the 1
Seas 1
had 1
brought 1
a 1
side 1
of 1
bacon 1
and 1
had 1
about 1
worn 1
himself 1
out 1
with 1
getting 1
it 1
there 1
Finn 1
the 1
Red 1
Handed 1
had 1
stolen 1
a 1
skillet 1
and 1
a 1
quantity 1
of 1
half 1
cured 1
leaf 1
tobacco 1
and 1
had 1
also 1
brought 1
a 1
few 1
corn 1
cobs 1
to 1
make 1
pipes 1
with 1
But 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
pirates 1
smoked 1
or 1
chewed 1
but 1
himself 1
The 1
Black 1
Avenger 1
of 1
the 1
Spanish 1
Main 1
said 1
it 1
would 1
never 1
do 1
to 1
start 1
without 1
some 1
fire 1
That 1
was 1
a 1
wise 1
thought 1
matches 1
were 1
hardly 1
known 1
there 1
in 1
that 1
day 1
They 1
saw 1
a 1
fire 1
smouldering 1
upon 1
a 1
great 1
raft 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
above 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
stealthily 1
thither 1
and 1
helped 1
themselves 1
to 1
a 1
chunk 1
They 1
made 1
an 1
imposing 1
adventure 1
of 1
it 1
saying 1
Hist 1
every 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
and 1
suddenly 1
halting 1
with 1
finger 1
on 1
lip 1
moving 1
with 1
hands 1
on 1
imaginary 1
dagger 1
hilts 1
and 1
giving 1
orders 1
in 1
dismal 1
whispers 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
foe 1
stirred 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
have 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
hilt 1
because 1
dead 1
men 1
tell 1
no 1
tales 1
They 1
knew 1
well 1
enough 1
that 1
the 1
raftsmen 1
were 1
all 1
down 1
at 1
the 1
village 1
laying 1
in 1
stores 1
or 1
having 1
a 1
spree 1
but 1
still 1
that 1
was 1
no 1
excuse 1
for 1
their 1
conducting 1
this 1
thing 1
in 1
an 1
unpiratical 1
way 1
They 1
shoved 1
off 1
presently 1
Tom 1
in 1
command 1
Huck 1
at 1
the 1
after 1
oar 1
and 1
Joe 1
at 1
the 1
forward 1
Tom 1
stood 1
amidships 1
gloomy 1
browed 1
and 1
with 1
folded 1
arms 1
and 1
gave 1
his 1
orders 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
stern 1
whisper 1
Luff 1
and 1
bring 1
her 1

Point 1

As 1
the 1
boys 1
steadily 1
and 1
monotonously 1
drove 1
the 1
raft 1
toward 1
mid 1
stream 1
it 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
understood 1
that 1
these 1
orders 1
were 1
given 1
only 1
for 1
style 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
intended 1
to 1
mean 1
anything 1
in 1
particular 1

The 1
raft 1
drew 1
beyond 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
the 1
boys 1
pointed 1
her 1
head 1
right 1
and 1
then 1
lay 1
on 1
their 1
oars 1
The 1
river 1
was 1
not 1
high 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
mile 1
current 1
Hardly 1
a 1
word 1
was 1
said 1
during 1
the 1
next 1
three 1
quarters 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
Now 1
the 1
raft 1
was 1
passing 1
before 1
the 1
distant 1
town 1
Two 1
or 1
three 1
glimmering 1
lights 1
showed 1
where 1
it 1
lay 1
peacefully 1
sleeping 1
beyond 1
the 1
vague 1
vast 1
sweep 1
of 1
star 1
gemmed 1
water 1
unconscious 1
of 1
the 1
tremendous 1
event 1
that 1
was 1
happening 1
The 1
Black 1
Avenger 1
stood 1
still 1
with 1
folded 1
arms 1
looking 1
his 1
last 1
upon 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
his 1
former 1
joys 1
and 1
his 1
later 1
sufferings 1
and 1
wishing 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
now 1
abroad 1
on 1
the 1
wild 1
sea 1
facing 1
peril 1
and 1
death 1
with 1
dauntless 1
heart 1
going 1
to 1
his 1
doom 1
with 1
a 1
grim 1
smile 1
on 1
his 1
lips 1
It 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
small 1
strain 1
on 1
his 1
imagination 1
to 1
remove 1
Jackson 1
s 1
Island 1
beyond 1
eye 1
shot 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
looked 1
his 1
last 1
with 1
a 1
broken 1
and 1
satisfied 1
heart 1
The 1
other 1
pirates 1
were 1
looking 1
their 1
last 1
too 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
looked 1
so 1
long 1
that 1
they 1
came 1
near 1
letting 1
the 1
current 1
drift 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
range 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
But 1
they 1
discovered 1
the 1
danger 1
in 1
time 1
and 1
made 1
shift 1
to 1
avert 1
it 1
About 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
the 1
raft 1
grounded 1
on 1
the 1
bar 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
above 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
they 1
waded 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
until 1
they 1
had 1
landed 1
their 1
freight 1
Part 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
raft 1
s 1
belongings 1
consisted 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
sail 1
and 1
this 1
they 1
spread 1
over 1
a 1
nook 1
in 1
the 1
bushes 1
for 1
a 1
tent 1
to 1
shelter 1
their 1
provisions 1
but 1
they 1
themselves 1
would 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air 1
in 1
good 1
weather 1
as 1
became 1
outlaws 1
They 1
built 1
a 1
fire 1
against 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
log 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
steps 1
within 1
the 1
sombre 1
depths 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
then 1
cooked 1
some 1
bacon 1
in 1
the 1
frying 1
pan 1
for 1
supper 1
and 1
used 1
up 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
corn 1
pone 1
stock 1
they 1
had 1
brought 1
It 1
seemed 1
glorious 1
sport 1
to 1
be 1
feasting 1
in 1
that 1
wild 1
free 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
virgin 1
forest 1
of 1
an 1
unexplored 1
and 1
uninhabited 1
island 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
haunts 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
never 1
would 1
return 1
to 1
civilization 1
The 1
climbing 1
fire 1
lit 1
up 1
their 1
faces 1
and 1
threw 1
its 1
ruddy 1
glare 1
upon 1
the 1
pillared 1
tree 1
trunks 1
of 1
their 1
forest 1
temple 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
varnished 1
foliage 1
and 1
festooning 1
vines 1
When 1
the 1
last 1
crisp 1
slice 1
of 1
bacon 1
was 1
gone 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
allowance 1
of 1
corn 1
pone 1
devoured 1
the 1
boys 1
stretched 1
themselves 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
grass 1
filled 1
with 1
contentment 1
They 1
could 1
have 1
found 1
a 1
cooler 1
place 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
not 1
deny 1
themselves 1
such 1
a 1
romantic 1
feature 1
as 1
the 1
roasting 1
campfire 1
Ain 1
t 1
it 1
gay 1
said 1
Joe 1
It 1
s 1
nuts 1
said 1
Tom 1
What 1
would 1
the 1
boys 1
say 1
if 1
they 1
could 1
see 1
us 1
Say 1
Well 1
they 1
d 1
just 1
die 1
to 1
be 1
here 1
hey 1
Hucky 1
I 1
reckon 1
so 1
said 1
Huckleberry 1
anyways 1
I 1
m 1
suited 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
nothing 1
better 1
n 1

I 1
don 1
t 1

get 1
enough 1
to 1
eat 1
gen 1
ally 1
and 1
here 1
they 1
can 1
t 1
come 1
and 1
pick 1
at 1
a 1
feller 1
and 1
bullyrag 1
him 1
so 1
It 1
s 1
just 1
the 1
life 1
for 1
me 1
said 1
Tom 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
mornings 1
and 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
school 1
and 1
wash 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
blame 1
foolishness 1
You 1
see 1
a 1
pirate 1
don 1
t 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
Joe 1
when 1
he 1
s 1
ashore 1
but 1
a 1
hermit 1
he 1
has 1
to 1
be 1
praying 1
considerable 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
don 1
t 1
have 1
any 1
fun 1
anyway 1
all 1
by 1
himself 1
that 1
way 1
Oh 1
yes 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
said 1
Joe 1
but 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
thought 1
much 1
about 1
it 1
you 1
know 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
rather 1
be 1
a 1
pirate 1
now 1
that 1
I 1
ve 1
tried 1
it 1
You 1
see 1
said 1
Tom 1
people 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
much 1
on 1
hermits 1
nowadays 1
like 1
they 1
used 1
to 1
in 1
old 1
times 1
but 1
a 1
pirate 1
s 1
always 1
respected 1
And 1
a 1
hermit 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
sleep 1
on 1
the 1
hardest 1
place 1
he 1
can 1
find 1
and 1
put 1
sackcloth 1
and 1
ashes 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
stand 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
rain 1
and 1
What 1
does 1
he 1
put 1
sackcloth 1
and 1
ashes 1
on 1
his 1
head 1
for 1
inquired 1
Huck 1
I 1
dono 1
But 1
they 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
Hermits 1
always 1
do 1
You 1
d 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
a 1
hermit 1
Dern 1
d 1
if 1
I 1
would 1
said 1
Huck 1
Well 1
what 1
would 1
you 1
do 1
I 1
dono 1
But 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
that 1
Why 1
Huck 1
you 1
d 1
have 1
to 1
How 1
d 1
you 1
get 1
around 1
it 1
Why 1
I 1
just 1
wouldn 1
t 1
stand 1
it 1
I 1
d 1
run 1
away 1
Run 1
away 1
Well 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
nice 1
old 1
slouch 1
of 1
a 1
hermit 1
You 1
d 1
be 1
a 1
disgrace 1
The 1
Red 1
Handed 1
made 1
no 1
response 1
being 1
better 1
employed 1
He 1
had 1
finished 1
gouging 1
out 1
a 1
cob 1
and 1
now 1
he 1
fitted 1
a 1
weed 1
stem 1
to 1
it 1
loaded 1
it 1
with 1
tobacco 1
and 1
was 1
pressing 1
a 1
coal 1
to 1
the 1
charge 1
and 1
blowing 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
fragrant 1
smoke 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
full 1
bloom 1
of 1
luxurious 1
contentment 1
The 1
other 1
pirates 1
envied 1
him 1
this 1
majestic 1
vice 1
and 1
secretly 1
resolved 1
to 1
acquire 1
it 1
shortly 1
Presently 1
Huck 1
said 1
What 1
does 1
pirates 1
have 1
to 1
do 1
Tom 1
said 1
Oh 1
they 1
have 1
just 1
a 1
bully 1
time 1
take 1
ships 1
and 1
burn 1
them 1
and 1
get 1
the 1
money 1
and 1
bury 1
it 1
in 1
awful 1
places 1
in 1
their 1
island 1
where 1
there 1
s 1
ghosts 1
and 1
things 1
to 1
watch 1
it 1
and 1
kill 1
everybody 1
in 1
the 1

em 1

plank 1
And 1
they 1
carry 1
the 1
women 1
to 1
the 1
island 1
said 1
Joe 1
they 1
don 1
t 1

the 1
women 1
No 1
assented 1
Tom 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
kill 1
the 1
women 1
they 1
re 1
too 1
noble 1
And 1
the 1
women 1

always 1
beautiful 1
too 1
And 1
don 1
t 1
they 1
wear 1
the 1
bulliest 1
clothes 1
Oh 1
no 1
All 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
and 1
di 1
monds 1
said 1
Joe 1
with 1
enthusiasm 1
Who 1
said 1
Huck 1
Why 1
the 1
pirates 1
Huck 1
scanned 1
his 1
own 1
clothing 1
forlornly 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
dressed 1
fitten 1
for 1
a 1
pirate 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
a 1
regretful 1
pathos 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
but 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
none 1
but 1
these 1
But 1
the 1
other 1
boys 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
fine 1
clothes 1
would 1
come 1
fast 1
enough 1
after 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
begun 1
their 1
adventures 1
They 1
made 1
him 1
understand 1
that 1
his 1
poor 1
rags 1
would 1
do 1
to 1
begin 1
with 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
customary 1
for 1
wealthy 1
pirates 1
to 1
start 1
with 1
a 1
proper 1
wardrobe 1
Gradually 1
their 1
talk 1
died 1
out 1
and 1
drowsiness 1
began 1
to 1
steal 1
upon 1
the 1
eyelids 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
waifs 1
The 1
pipe 1
dropped 1
from 1
the 1
fingers 1
of 1
the 1
Red 1
Handed 1
and 1
he 1
slept 1
the 1
sleep 1
of 1
the 1
conscience 1
free 1
and 1
the 1
weary 1
The 1
Terror 1
of 1
the 1
Seas 1
and 1
the 1
Black 1
Avenger 1
of 1
the 1
Spanish 1
Main 1
had 1
more 1
difficulty 1
in 1
getting 1
to 1
sleep 1
They 1
said 1
their 1
prayers 1
inwardly 1
and 1
lying 1
down 1
since 1
there 1
was 1
nobody 1
there 1
with 1
authority 1
to 1
make 1
them 1
kneel 1
and 1
recite 1
aloud 1
in 1
truth 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
mind 1
not 1
to 1
say 1
them 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
to 1
proceed 1
to 1
such 1
lengths 1
as 1
that 1
lest 1
they 1
might 1
call 1
down 1
a 1
sudden 1
and 1
special 1
thunderbolt 1
from 1
heaven 1
Then 1
at 1
once 1
they 1
reached 1
and 1
hovered 1
upon 1
the 1
imminent 1
verge 1
of 1
sleep 1
but 1
an 1
intruder 1
came 1
now 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
down 1
It 1
was 1
conscience 1
They 1
began 1
to 1
feel 1
a 1
vague 1
fear 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
doing 1
wrong 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
next 1
they 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
stolen 1
meat 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
real 1
torture 1
came 1
They 1
tried 1
to 1
argue 1
it 1
away 1
by 1
reminding 1
conscience 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
purloined 1
sweetmeats 1
and 1
apples 1
scores 1
of 1
times 1
but 1
conscience 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
appeased 1
by 1
such 1
thin 1
plausibilities 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
getting 1
around 1
the 1
stubborn 1
fact 1
that 1
taking 1
sweetmeats 1
was 1
only 1
hooking 1
while 1
taking 1
bacon 1
and 1
hams 1
and 1
such 1
valuables 1
was 1
plain 1
simple 1
stealing 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
command 1
against 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
Bible 1
So 1
they 1
inwardly 1
resolved 1
that 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
they 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
business 1
their 1
piracies 1
should 1
not 1
again 1
be 1
sullied 1
with 1
the 1
crime 1
of 1
stealing 1
Then 1
conscience 1
granted 1
a 1
truce 1
and 1
these 1
curiously 1
inconsistent 1
pirates 1
fell 1
peacefully 1
to 1
sleep 1
CHAPTER 1
XIV 1
WHEN 1
Tom 1
awoke 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
he 1
wondered 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
sat 1
up 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
looked 1
around 1
Then 1
he 1
comprehended 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
cool 1
gray 1
dawn 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
delicious 1
sense 1
of 1
repose 1
and 1
peace 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
pervading 1
calm 1
and 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
woods 1
Not 1
a 1
leaf 1
stirred 1
not 1
a 1
sound 1
obtruded 1
upon 1
great 1
Nature 1
s 1
meditation 1
Beaded 1
dewdrops 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
grasses 1
A 1
white 1
layer 1
of 1
ashes 1
covered 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
a 1
thin 1
blue 1
breath 1
of 1
smoke 1
rose 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
Joe 1
and 1
Huck 1
still 1
slept 1
Now 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
a 1
bird 1
called 1
another 1
answered 1
presently 1
the 1
hammering 1
of 1
a 1
woodpecker 1
was 1
heard 1
Gradually 1
the 1
cool 1
dim 1
gray 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
whitened 1
and 1
as 1
gradually 1
sounds 1
multiplied 1
and 1
life 1
manifested 1
itself 1
The 1
marvel 1
of 1
Nature 1
shaking 1
off 1
sleep 1
and 1
going 1
to 1
work 1
unfolded 1
itself 1
to 1
the 1
musing 1
boy 1
A 1
little 1
green 1
worm 1
came 1
crawling 1
over 1
a 1
dewy 1
leaf 1
lifting 1
two 1
thirds 1
of 1
his 1
body 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
and 1
sniffing 1
around 1
then 1
proceeding 1
again 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
measuring 1
Tom 1
said 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
worm 1
approached 1
him 1
of 1
its 1
own 1
accord 1
he 1
sat 1
as 1
still 1
as 1
a 1
stone 1
with 1
his 1
hopes 1
rising 1
and 1
falling 1
by 1
turns 1
as 1
the 1
creature 1
still 1
came 1
toward 1
him 1
or 1
seemed 1
inclined 1
to 1
go 1
elsewhere 1
and 1
when 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
considered 1
a 1
painful 1
moment 1
with 1
its 1
curved 1
body 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
then 1
came 1
decisively 1
down 1
upon 1
Tom 1
s 1
leg 1
and 1
began 1
a 1
journey 1
over 1
him 1
his 1
whole 1
heart 1
was 1
glad 1
for 1
that 1
meant 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
new 1
suit 1
of 1
clothes 1
without 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
doubt 1
a 1
gaudy 1
piratical 1
uniform 1
Now 1
a 1
procession 1
of 1
ants 1
appeared 1
from 1
nowhere 1
in 1
particular 1
and 1
went 1
about 1
their 1
labors 1
one 1
struggled 1
manfully 1
by 1
with 1
a 1
dead 1
spider 1
five 1
times 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
itself 1
in 1
its 1
arms 1
and 1
lugged 1
it 1
straight 1
up 1
a 1
tree 1
trunk 1
A 1
brown 1
spotted 1
lady 1
bug 1
climbed 1
the 1
dizzy 1
height 1
of 1
a 1
grass 1
blade 1
and 1
Tom 1
bent 1
down 1
close 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
said 1
Lady 1
bug 1
lady 1
bug 1
fly 1
away 1
home 1
your 1
house 1
is 1
on 1
fire 1
your 1
children 1
s 1
alone 1
and 1
she 1
took 1
wing 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
see 1
about 1
it 1
which 1
did 1
not 1
surprise 1
the 1
boy 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
of 1
old 1
that 1
this 1
insect 1
was 1
credulous 1
about 1
conflagrations 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
practised 1
upon 1
its 1
simplicity 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
A 1
tumblebug 1
came 1
next 1
heaving 1
sturdily 1
at 1
its 1
ball 1
and 1
Tom 1
touched 1
the 1
creature 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
shut 1
its 1
legs 1
against 1
its 1
body 1
and 1
pretend 1
to 1
be 1
dead 1
The 1
birds 1
were 1
fairly 1
rioting 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
A 1
catbird 1
the 1
Northern 1
mocker 1
lit 1
in 1
a 1
tree 1
over 1
Tom 1
s 1
head 1
and 1
trilled 1
out 1
her 1
imitations 1
of 1
her 1
neighbors 1
in 1
a 1
rapture 1
of 1
enjoyment 1
then 1
a 1
shrill 1
jay 1
swept 1
down 1
a 1
flash 1
of 1
blue 1
flame 1
and 1
stopped 1
on 1
a 1
twig 1
almost 1
within 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
reach 1
cocked 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
eyed 1
the 1
strangers 1
with 1
a 1
consuming 1
curiosity 1
a 1
gray 1
squirrel 1
and 1
a 1
big 1
fellow 1
of 1
the 1
fox 1
kind 1
came 1
skurrying 1
along 1
sitting 1
up 1
at 1
intervals 1
to 1
inspect 1
and 1
chatter 1
at 1
the 1
boys 1
for 1
the 1
wild 1
things 1
had 1
probably 1
never 1
seen 1
a 1
human 1
being 1
before 1
and 1
scarcely 1
knew 1
whether 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
or 1
not 1
All 1
Nature 1
was 1
wide 1
awake 1
and 1
stirring 1
now 1
long 1
lances 1
of 1
sunlight 1
pierced 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
dense 1
foliage 1
far 1
and 1
near 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
butterflies 1
came 1
fluttering 1
upon 1
the 1
scene 1
Tom 1
stirred 1
up 1
the 1
other 1
pirates 1
and 1
they 1
all 1
clattered 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
shout 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
were 1
stripped 1
and 1
chasing 1
after 1
and 1
tumbling 1
over 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
the 1
shallow 1
limpid 1
water 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
sandbar 1
They 1
felt 1
no 1
longing 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
village 1
sleeping 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
beyond 1
the 1
majestic 1
waste 1
of 1
water 1
A 1
vagrant 1
current 1
or 1
a 1
slight 1
rise 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
had 1
carried 1
off 1
their 1
raft 1
but 1
this 1
only 1
gratified 1
them 1
since 1
its 1
going 1
was 1
something 1
like 1
burning 1
the 1
bridge 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
civilization 1
They 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
wonderfully 1
refreshed 1
glad 1
hearted 1
and 1
ravenous 1
and 1
they 1
soon 1
had 1
the 1
camp 1
fire 1
blazing 1
up 1
again 1
Huck 1
found 1
a 1
spring 1
of 1
clear 1
cold 1
water 1
close 1
by 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
made 1
cups 1
of 1
broad 1
oak 1
or 1
hickory 1
leaves 1
and 1
felt 1
that 1
water 1
sweetened 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
wildwood 1
charm 1
as 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
enough 1
substitute 1
for 1
coffee 1
While 1
Joe 1
was 1
slicing 1
bacon 1
for 1
breakfast 1
Tom 1
and 1
Huck 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
a 1
minute 1
they 1
stepped 1
to 1
a 1
promising 1
nook 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
and 1
threw 1
in 1
their 1
lines 1
almost 1
immediately 1
they 1
had 1
reward 1
Joe 1
had 1
not 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
impatient 1
before 1
they 1
were 1
back 1
again 1
with 1
some 1
handsome 1
bass 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
sun 1
perch 1
and 1
a 1
small 1
catfish 1
provisions 1
enough 1
for 1
quite 1
a 1
family 1
They 1
fried 1
the 1
fish 1
with 1
the 1
bacon 1
and 1
were 1
astonished 1
for 1
no 1
fish 1
had 1
ever 1
seemed 1
so 1
delicious 1
before 1
They 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
quicker 1
a 1
fresh 1
water 1
fish 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
fire 1
after 1
he 1
is 1
caught 1
the 1
better 1
he 1
is 1
and 1
they 1
reflected 1
little 1
upon 1
what 1
a 1
sauce 1
open 1
air 1
sleeping 1
open 1
air 1
exercise 1
bathing 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
ingredient 1
of 1
hunger 1
make 1
too 1
They 1
lay 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
after 1
breakfast 1
while 1
Huck 1
had 1
a 1
smoke 1
and 1
then 1
went 1
off 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
on 1
an 1
exploring 1
expedition 1
They 1
tramped 1
gayly 1
along 1
over 1
decaying 1
logs 1
through 1
tangled 1
underbrush 1
among 1
solemn 1
monarchs 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
hung 1
from 1
their 1
crowns 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
with 1
a 1
drooping 1
regalia 1
of 1
grape 1
vines 1
Now 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
came 1
upon 1
snug 1
nooks 1
carpeted 1
with 1
grass 1
and 1
jeweled 1
with 1
flowers 1
They 1
found 1
plenty 1
of 1
things 1
to 1
be 1
delighted 1
with 1
but 1
nothing 1
to 1
be 1
astonished 1
at 1
They 1
discovered 1
that 1
the 1
island 1
was 1
about 1
three 1
miles 1
long 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
wide 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
shore 1
it 1
lay 1
closest 1
to 1
was 1
only 1
separated 1
from 1
it 1
by 1
a 1
narrow 1
channel 1
hardly 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
wide 1
They 1
took 1
a 1
swim 1
about 1
every 1
hour 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
close 1
upon 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
They 1
were 1
too 1
hungry 1
to 1
stop 1
to 1
fish 1
but 1
they 1
fared 1
sumptuously 1
upon 1
cold 1
ham 1
and 1
then 1
threw 1
themselves 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
to 1
talk 1
But 1
the 1
talk 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
drag 1
and 1
then 1
died 1
The 1
stillness 1
the 1
solemnity 1
that 1
brooded 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
and 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
loneliness 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
upon 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
They 1
fell 1
to 1
thinking 1
A 1
sort 1
of 1
undefined 1
longing 1
crept 1
upon 1
them 1
This 1
took 1
dim 1
shape 1
presently 1
it 1
was 1
budding 1
homesickness 1
Even 1
Finn 1
the 1
Red 1
Handed 1
was 1
dreaming 1
of 1
his 1
doorsteps 1
and 1
empty 1
hogsheads 1
But 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
ashamed 1
of 1
their 1
weakness 1
and 1
none 1
was 1
brave 1
enough 1
to 1
speak 1
his 1
thought 1
For 1
some 1
time 1
now 1
the 1
boys 1
had 1
been 1
dully 1
conscious 1
of 1
a 1
peculiar 1
sound 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
just 1
as 1
one 1
sometimes 1
is 1
of 1
the 1
ticking 1
of 1
a 1
clock 1
which 1
he 1
takes 1
no 1
distinct 1
note 1
of 1
But 1
now 1
this 1
mysterious 1
sound 1
became 1
more 1
pronounced 1
and 1
forced 1
a 1
recognition 1
The 1
boys 1
started 1
glanced 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
then 1
each 1
assumed 1
a 1
listening 1
attitude 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
silence 1
profound 1
and 1
unbroken 1
then 1
a 1
deep 1
sullen 1
boom 1
came 1
floating 1
down 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
distance 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
exclaimed 1
Joe 1
under 1
his 1
breath 1
I 1
wonder 1
said 1
Tom 1
in 1
a 1
whisper 1
Tain 1
t 1
thunder 1
said 1
Huckleberry 1
in 1
an 1
awed 1
tone 1
becuz 1
thunder 1
Hark 1
said 1
Tom 1
Listen 1
don 1
t 1
talk 1
They 1
waited 1
a 1
time 1
that 1
seemed 1
an 1
age 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
same 1
muffled 1
boom 1
troubled 1
the 1
solemn 1
hush 1
Let 1
s 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
They 1
sprang 1
to 1
their 1
feet 1
and 1
hurried 1
to 1
the 1
shore 1
toward 1
the 1
town 1
They 1
parted 1
the 1
bushes 1
on 1
the 1
bank 1
and 1
peered 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
The 1
little 1
steam 1
ferry 1
boat 1
was 1
about 1
a 1
mile 1
below 1
the 1
village 1
drifting 1
with 1
the 1
current 1
Her 1
broad 1
deck 1
seemed 1
crowded 1
with 1
people 1
There 1
were 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
skiffs 1
rowing 1
about 1
or 1
floating 1
with 1
the 1
stream 1
in 1
the 1
neighborhood 1
of 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
but 1
the 1
boys 1
could 1
not 1
determine 1
what 1
the 1
men 1
in 1
them 1
were 1
doing 1
Presently 1
a 1
great 1
jet 1
of 1
white 1
smoke 1
burst 1
from 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
s 1
side 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
expanded 1
and 1
rose 1
in 1
a 1
lazy 1
cloud 1
that 1
same 1
dull 1
throb 1
of 1
sound 1
was 1
borne 1
to 1
the 1
listeners 1
again 1
I 1
know 1
now 1
exclaimed 1
Tom 1
somebody 1
s 1
drownded 1
That 1
s 1
it 1
said 1
Huck 1
they 1
done 1
that 1
last 1
summer 1
when 1
Bill 1
Turner 1
got 1
drownded 1
they 1
shoot 1
a 1
cannon 1
over 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
that 1
makes 1
him 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
Yes 1
and 1
they 1
take 1
loaves 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
put 1
quicksilver 1
in 1
em 1
and 1
set 1
em 1
afloat 1
and 1
wherever 1
there 1
s 1
anybody 1
that 1
s 1
drownded 1
they 1
ll 1
float 1
right 1
there 1
and 1
stop 1
Yes 1
I 1
ve 1
heard 1
about 1
that 1
said 1
Joe 1
I 1
wonder 1
what 1
makes 1
the 1
bread 1
do 1
that 1
Oh 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
bread 1
so 1
much 1
said 1
Tom 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
s 1
mostly 1
what 1
they 1
say 1
over 1
it 1
before 1
they 1
start 1
it 1
out 1
But 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
anything 1
over 1
it 1
said 1
Huck 1
I 1
ve 1
seen 1
em 1
and 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
Well 1
that 1
s 1
funny 1
said 1
Tom 1
But 1
maybe 1
they 1
say 1
it 1
to 1
themselves 1
Of 1
course 1
they 1
do 1
Anybody 1
might 1
know 1
that 1
The 1
other 1
boys 1
agreed 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
reason 1
in 1
what 1
Tom 1
said 1
because 1
an 1
ignorant 1
lump 1
of 1
bread 1
uninstructed 1
by 1
an 1
incantation 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
act 1
very 1
intelligently 1
when 1
set 1
upon 1
an 1
errand 1
of 1
such 1
gravity 1
By 1
jings 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
was 1
over 1
there 1
now 1
said 1
Joe 1
I 1
do 1
too 1
said 1
Huck 1
I 1
d 1
give 1
heaps 1
to 1
know 1
who 1
it 1
is 1
The 1
boys 1
still 1
listened 1
and 1
watched 1
Presently 1
a 1
revealing 1
thought 1
flashed 1
through 1
Tom 1
s 1
mind 1
and 1
he 1
exclaimed 1
Boys 1
I 1
know 1
who 1
s 1
drownded 1
it 1
s 1
us 1
They 1
felt 1
like 1
heroes 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
Here 1
was 1
a 1
gorgeous 1
triumph 1
they 1
were 1
missed 1
they 1
were 1
mourned 1
hearts 1
were 1
breaking 1
on 1
their 1
account 1
tears 1
were 1
being 1
shed 1
accusing 1
memories 1
of 1
unkindness 1
to 1
these 1
poor 1
lost 1
lads 1
were 1
rising 1
up 1
and 1
unavailing 1
regrets 1
and 1
remorse 1
were 1
being 1
indulged 1
and 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
departed 1
were 1
the 1
talk 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
and 1
the 1
envy 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
boys 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
this 1
dazzling 1
notoriety 1
was 1
concerned 1
This 1
was 1
fine 1
It 1
was 1
worth 1
while 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
pirate 1
after 1
all 1
As 1
twilight 1
drew 1
on 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
accustomed 1
business 1
and 1
the 1
skiffs 1
disappeared 1
The 1
pirates 1
returned 1
to 1
camp 1
They 1
were 1
jubilant 1
with 1
vanity 1
over 1
their 1
new 1
grandeur 1
and 1
the 1
illustrious 1
trouble 1
they 1
were 1
making 1
They 1
caught 1
fish 1
cooked 1
supper 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
fell 1
to 1
guessing 1
at 1
what 1
the 1
village 1
was 1
thinking 1
and 1
saying 1
about 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
pictures 1
they 1
drew 1
of 1
the 1
public 1
distress 1
on 1
their 1
account 1
were 1
gratifying 1
to 1
look 1
upon 1
from 1
their 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
But 1
when 1
the 1
shadows 1
of 1
night 1
closed 1
them 1
in 1
they 1
gradually 1
ceased 1
to 1
talk 1
and 1
sat 1
gazing 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
with 1
their 1
minds 1
evidently 1
wandering 1
elsewhere 1
The 1
excitement 1
was 1
gone 1
now 1
and 1
Tom 1
and 1
Joe 1
could 1
not 1
keep 1
back 1
thoughts 1
of 1
certain 1
persons 1
at 1
home 1
who 1
were 1
not 1
enjoying 1
this 1
fine 1
frolic 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
Misgivings 1
came 1
they 1
grew 1
troubled 1
and 1
unhappy 1
a 1
sigh 1
or 1
two 1
escaped 1
unawares 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Joe 1
timidly 1
ventured 1
upon 1
a 1
roundabout 1
feeler 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
the 1
others 1
might 1
look 1
upon 1
a 1
return 1
to 1
civilization 1
not 1
right 1
now 1
but 1
Tom 1
withered 1
him 1
with 1
derision 1
Huck 1
being 1
uncommitted 1
as 1
yet 1
joined 1
in 1
with 1
Tom 1
and 1
the 1
waverer 1
quickly 1
explained 1
and 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
scrape 1
with 1
as 1
little 1
taint 1
of 1
chicken 1
hearted 1
home 1
sickness 1
clinging 1
to 1
his 1
garments 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
Mutiny 1
was 1
effectually 1
laid 1
to 1
rest 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
As 1
the 1
night 1
deepened 1
Huck 1
began 1
to 1
nod 1
and 1
presently 1
to 1
snore 1
Joe 1
followed 1
next 1
Tom 1
lay 1
upon 1
his 1
elbow 1
motionless 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
watching 1
the 1
two 1
intently 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
got 1
up 1
cautiously 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
went 1
searching 1
among 1
the 1
grass 1
and 1
the 1
flickering 1
reflections 1
flung 1
by 1
the 1
campfire 1
He 1
picked 1
up 1
and 1
inspected 1
several 1
large 1
semi 1
cylinders 1
of 1
the 1
thin 1
white 1
bark 1
of 1
a 1
sycamore 1
and 1
finally 1
chose 1
two 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
suit 1
him 1
Then 1
he 1
knelt 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
painfully 1
wrote 1
something 1
upon 1
each 1
of 1
these 1
with 1
his 1
red 1
keel 1
one 1
he 1
rolled 1
up 1
and 1
put 1
in 1
his 1
jacket 1
pocket 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
he 1
put 1
in 1
Joe 1
s 1
hat 1
and 1
removed 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
owner 1
And 1
he 1
also 1
put 1
into 1
the 1
hat 1
certain 1
schoolboy 1
treasures 1
of 1
almost 1
inestimable 1
value 1
among 1
them 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
chalk 1
an 1
India 1
rubber 1
ball 1
three 1
fishhooks 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
marbles 1
known 1
as 1
a 1
sure 1
nough 1
crystal 1
Then 1
he 1
tiptoed 1
his 1
way 1
cautiously 1
among 1
the 1
trees 1
till 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
hearing 1
and 1
straightway 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
keen 1
run 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
sandbar 1
CHAPTER 1
XV 1
A 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
Tom 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
shoal 1
water 1
of 1
the 1
bar 1
wading 1
toward 1
the 1
Illinois 1
shore 1
Before 1
the 1
depth 1
reached 1
his 1
middle 1
he 1
was 1
halfway 1
over 1
the 1
current 1
would 1
permit 1
no 1
more 1
wading 1
now 1
so 1
he 1
struck 1
out 1
confidently 1
to 1
swim 1
the 1
remaining 1
hundred 1
yards 1
He 1
swam 1
quartering 1
upstream 1
but 1
still 1
was 1
swept 1
downward 1
rather 1
faster 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
expected 1
However 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
shore 1
finally 1
and 1
drifted 1
along 1
till 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
low 1
place 1
and 1
drew 1
himself 1
out 1
He 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
jacket 1
pocket 1
found 1
his 1
piece 1
of 1
bark 1
safe 1
and 1
then 1
struck 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
following 1
the 1
shore 1
with 1
streaming 1
garments 1
Shortly 1
before 1
ten 1
o 1
clock 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
into 1
an 1
open 1
place 1
opposite 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
lying 1
in 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
high 1
bank 1
Everything 1
was 1
quiet 1
under 1
the 1
blinking 1
stars 1
He 1
crept 1
down 1
the 1
bank 1
watching 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
eyes 1
slipped 1
into 1
the 1
water 1
swam 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
strokes 1
and 1
climbed 1
into 1
the 1
skiff 1
that 1
did 1
yawl 1
duty 1
at 1
the 1
boat 1
s 1
stern 1
He 1
laid 1
himself 1
down 1
under 1
the 1
thwarts 1
and 1
waited 1
panting 1
Presently 1
the 1
cracked 1
bell 1
tapped 1
and 1
a 1
voice 1
gave 1
the 1
order 1
to 1
cast 1
off 1
A 1
minute 1
or 1
two 1
later 1
the 1
skiff 1
s 1
head 1
was 1
standing 1
high 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
boat 1
s 1
swell 1
and 1
the 1
voyage 1
was 1
begun 1
Tom 1
felt 1
happy 1
in 1
his 1
success 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
boat 1
s 1
last 1
trip 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
twelve 1
or 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
the 1
wheels 1
stopped 1
and 1
Tom 1
slipped 1
overboard 1
and 1
swam 1
ashore 1
in 1
the 1
dusk 1
landing 1
fifty 1
yards 1
downstream 1
out 1
of 1
danger 1
of 1
possible 1
stragglers 1
He 1
flew 1
along 1
unfrequented 1
alleys 1
and 1
shortly 1
found 1
himself 1
at 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
back 1
fence 1
He 1
climbed 1
over 1
approached 1
the 1
ell 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
sitting 1
room 1
window 1
for 1
a 1
light 1
was 1
burning 1
there 1
There 1
sat 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
Sid 1
Mary 1
and 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
s 1
mother 1
grouped 1
together 1
talking 1
They 1
were 1
by 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
the 1
bed 1
was 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
Tom 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
softly 1
lift 1
the 1
latch 1
then 1
he 1
pressed 1
gently 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
yielded 1
a 1
crack 1
he 1
continued 1
pushing 1
cautiously 1
and 1
quaking 1
every 1
time 1
it 1
creaked 1
till 1
he 1
judged 1
he 1
might 1
squeeze 1
through 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
so 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
head 1
through 1
and 1
began 1
warily 1
What 1
makes 1
the 1
candle 1
blow 1
so 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
Tom 1
hurried 1
up 1
Why 1
that 1
door 1
s 1
open 1
I 1
believe 1
Why 1
of 1
course 1
it 1
is 1
No 1
end 1
of 1
strange 1
things 1
now 1
Go 1
long 1
and 1
shut 1
it 1
Sid 1
Tom 1
disappeared 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
He 1
lay 1
and 1
breathed 1
himself 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
crept 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
almost 1
touch 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
foot 1
But 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
saying 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
he 1
warn 1
t 1
bad 1
so 1
to 1
say 1
only 1
misch 1
ee 1
vous 1
Only 1
just 1
giddy 1
and 1
harum 1
scarum 1
you 1
know 1
He 1
warn 1
t 1
any 1
more 1
responsible 1
than 1
a 1
colt 1
He 1
never 1
meant 1
any 1
harm 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
best 1
hearted 1
boy 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
and 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
It 1
was 1
just 1
so 1
with 1
my 1
Joe 1
always 1
full 1
of 1
his 1
devilment 1
and 1
up 1
to 1
every 1
kind 1
of 1
mischief 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
as 1
unselfish 1
and 1
kind 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
and 1
laws 1
bless 1
me 1
to 1
think 1
I 1
went 1
and 1
whipped 1
him 1
for 1
taking 1
that 1
cream 1
never 1
once 1
recollecting 1
that 1
I 1
throwed 1
it 1
out 1
myself 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
sour 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
again 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
never 1
never 1
never 1
poor 1
abused 1
boy 1
And 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
sobbed 1
as 1
if 1
her 1
heart 1
would 1
break 1
I 1
hope 1
Tom 1
s 1
better 1
off 1
where 1
he 1
is 1
said 1
Sid 1
but 1
if 1
he 1
d 1
been 1
better 1
in 1
some 1
ways 1
Sid 1
Tom 1
felt 1
the 1
glare 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
s 1
eye 1
though 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
it 1
Not 1
a 1
word 1
against 1
my 1
Tom 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
s 1
gone 1
God 1
ll 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
him 1
never 1
you 1
trouble 1
your 1
self 1
sir 1
Oh 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
up 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
up 1
He 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
comfort 1
to 1
me 1
although 1
he 1
tormented 1
my 1
old 1
heart 1
out 1
of 1
me 1
most 1
The 1
Lord 1
giveth 1
and 1
the 1
Lord 1
hath 1
taken 1
away 1
Blessed 1
be 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Lord 1
But 1
it 1
s 1
so 1
hard 1
Oh 1
it 1
s 1
so 1
hard 1
Only 1
last 1
Saturday 1
my 1
Joe 1
busted 1
a 1
firecracker 1
right 1
under 1
my 1
nose 1
and 1
I 1
knocked 1
him 1
sprawling 1
Little 1
did 1
I 1
know 1
then 1
how 1
soon 1
Oh 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
do 1
over 1
again 1
I 1
d 1
hug 1
him 1
and 1
bless 1
him 1
for 1
it 1
Yes 1
yes 1
yes 1
I 1
know 1
just 1
how 1
you 1
feel 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
I 1
know 1
just 1
exactly 1
how 1
you 1
feel 1
No 1
longer 1
ago 1
than 1
yesterday 1
noon 1
my 1
Tom 1
took 1
and 1
filled 1
the 1
cat 1
full 1
of 1
Pain 1
killer 1
and 1
I 1
did 1
think 1
the 1
cretur 1
would 1
tear 1
the 1
house 1
down 1
And 1
God 1
forgive 1
me 1
I 1
cracked 1
Tom 1
s 1
head 1
with 1
my 1
thimble 1
poor 1
boy 1
poor 1
dead 1
boy 1
But 1
he 1
s 1
out 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
troubles 1
now 1
And 1
the 1
last 1
words 1
I 1
ever 1
heard 1
him 1
say 1
was 1
to 1
reproach 1
But 1
this 1
memory 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
and 1
she 1
broke 1
entirely 1
down 1
Tom 1
was 1
snuffling 1
now 1
himself 1
and 1
more 1
in 1
pity 1
of 1
himself 1
than 1
anybody 1
else 1
He 1
could 1
hear 1
Mary 1
crying 1
and 1
putting 1
in 1
a 1
kindly 1
word 1
for 1
him 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
He 1
began 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
nobler 1
opinion 1
of 1
himself 1
than 1
ever 1
before 1
Still 1
he 1
was 1
sufficiently 1
touched 1
by 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
grief 1
to 1
long 1
to 1
rush 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
overwhelm 1
her 1
with 1
joy 1
and 1
the 1
theatrical 1
gorgeousness 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
appealed 1
strongly 1
to 1
his 1
nature 1
too 1
but 1
he 1
resisted 1
and 1
lay 1
still 1
He 1
went 1
on 1
listening 1
and 1
gathered 1
by 1
odds 1
and 1
ends 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
conjectured 1
at 1
first 1
that 1
the 1
boys 1
had 1
got 1
drowned 1
while 1
taking 1
a 1
swim 1
then 1
the 1
small 1
raft 1
had 1
been 1
missed 1
next 1
certain 1
boys 1
said 1
the 1
missing 1
lads 1
had 1
promised 1
that 1
the 1
village 1
should 1
hear 1
something 1
soon 1
the 1
wise 1
heads 1
had 1
put 1
this 1
and 1
that 1
together 1
and 1
decided 1
that 1
the 1
lads 1
had 1
gone 1
off 1
on 1
that 1
raft 1
and 1
would 1
turn 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
next 1
town 1
below 1
presently 1
but 1
toward 1
noon 1
the 1
raft 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
lodged 1
against 1
the 1
Missouri 1
shore 1
some 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
miles 1
below 1
the 1
village 1
and 1
then 1
hope 1
perished 1
they 1
must 1
be 1
drowned 1
else 1
hunger 1
would 1
have 1
driven 1
them 1
home 1
by 1
nightfall 1
if 1
not 1
sooner 1
It 1
was 1
believed 1
that 1
the 1
search 1
for 1
the 1
bodies 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
fruitless 1
effort 1
merely 1
because 1
the 1
drowning 1
must 1
have 1
occurred 1
in 1
mid 1
channel 1
since 1
the 1
boys 1
being 1
good 1
swimmers 1
would 1
otherwise 1
have 1
escaped 1
to 1
shore 1
This 1
was 1
Wednesday 1
night 1
If 1
the 1
bodies 1
continued 1
missing 1
until 1
Sunday 1
all 1
hope 1
would 1
be 1
given 1
over 1
and 1
the 1
funerals 1
would 1
be 1
preached 1
on 1
that 1
morning 1
Tom 1
shuddered 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
gave 1
a 1
sobbing 1
goodnight 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
go 1
Then 1
with 1
a 1
mutual 1
impulse 1
the 1
two 1
bereaved 1
women 1
flung 1
themselves 1
into 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
arms 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
consoling 1
cry 1
and 1
then 1
parted 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
was 1
tender 1
far 1
beyond 1
her 1
wont 1
in 1
her 1
goodnight 1
to 1
Sid 1
and 1
Mary 1
Sid 1
snuffled 1
a 1
bit 1
and 1
Mary 1
went 1
off 1
crying 1
with 1
all 1
her 1
heart 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
knelt 1
down 1
and 1
prayed 1
for 1
Tom 1
so 1
touchingly 1
so 1
appealingly 1
and 1
with 1
such 1
measureless 1
love 1
in 1
her 1
words 1
and 1
her 1
old 1
trembling 1
voice 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
weltering 1
in 1
tears 1
again 1
long 1
before 1
she 1
was 1
through 1
He 1
had 1
to 1
keep 1
still 1
long 1
after 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
for 1
she 1
kept 1
making 1
broken 1
hearted 1
ejaculations 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
tossing 1
unrestfully 1
and 1
turning 1
over 1
But 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
was 1
still 1
only 1
moaning 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
her 1
sleep 1
Now 1
the 1
boy 1
stole 1
out 1
rose 1
gradually 1
by 1
the 1
bedside 1
shaded 1
the 1
candle 1
light 1
with 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
stood 1
regarding 1
her 1
His 1
heart 1
was 1
full 1
of 1
pity 1
for 1
her 1
He 1
took 1
out 1
his 1
sycamore 1
scroll 1
and 1
placed 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
candle 1
But 1
something 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
lingered 1
considering 1
His 1
face 1
lighted 1
with 1
a 1
happy 1
solution 1
of 1
his 1
thought 1
he 1
put 1
the 1
bark 1
hastily 1
in 1
his 1
pocket 1
Then 1
he 1
bent 1
over 1
and 1
kissed 1
the 1
faded 1
lips 1
and 1
straightway 1
made 1
his 1
stealthy 1
exit 1
latching 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
He 1
threaded 1
his 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
ferry 1
landing 1
found 1
nobody 1
at 1
large 1
there 1
and 1
walked 1
boldly 1
on 1
board 1
the 1
boat 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
tenantless 1
except 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
watchman 1
who 1
always 1
turned 1
in 1
and 1
slept 1
like 1
a 1
graven 1
image 1
He 1
untied 1
the 1
skiff 1
at 1
the 1
stern 1
slipped 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
soon 1
rowing 1
cautiously 1
upstream 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
pulled 1
a 1
mile 1
above 1
the 1
village 1
he 1
started 1
quartering 1
across 1
and 1
bent 1
himself 1
stoutly 1
to 1
his 1
work 1
He 1
hit 1
the 1
landing 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
neatly 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
familiar 1
bit 1
of 1
work 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
moved 1
to 1
capture 1
the 1
skiff 1
arguing 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
considered 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
therefore 1
legitimate 1
prey 1
for 1
a 1
pirate 1
but 1
he 1
knew 1
a 1
thorough 1
search 1
would 1
be 1
made 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
might 1
end 1
in 1
revelations 1
So 1
he 1
stepped 1
ashore 1
and 1
entered 1
the 1
woods 1
He 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
long 1
rest 1
torturing 1
himself 1
meanwhile 1
to 1
keep 1
awake 1
and 1
then 1
started 1
warily 1
down 1
the 1
home 1
stretch 1
The 1
night 1
was 1
far 1
spent 1
It 1
was 1
broad 1
daylight 1
before 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
fairly 1
abreast 1
the 1
island 1
bar 1
He 1
rested 1
again 1
until 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
well 1
up 1
and 1
gilding 1
the 1
great 1
river 1
with 1
its 1
splendor 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
A 1
little 1
later 1
he 1
paused 1
dripping 1
upon 1
the 1
threshold 1
of 1
the 1
camp 1
and 1
heard 1
Joe 1
say 1
No 1
Tom 1
s 1
true 1
blue 1
Huck 1
and 1
he 1
ll 1
come 1
back 1
He 1
won 1
t 1
desert 1
He 1
knows 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
disgrace 1
to 1
a 1
pirate 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
too 1
proud 1
for 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
thing 1
He 1
s 1
up 1
to 1
something 1
or 1
other 1
Now 1
I 1
wonder 1
what 1
Well 1
the 1
things 1
is 1
ours 1
anyway 1
ain 1
t 1
they 1
Pretty 1
near 1
but 1
not 1
yet 1
Huck 1
The 1
writing 1
says 1
they 1
are 1
if 1
he 1
ain 1
t 1
back 1
here 1
to 1
breakfast 1
Which 1
he 1
is 1
exclaimed 1
Tom 1
with 1
fine 1
dramatic 1
effect 1
stepping 1
grandly 1
into 1
camp 1
A 1
sumptuous 1
breakfast 1
of 1
bacon 1
and 1
fish 1
was 1
shortly 1
provided 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
boys 1
set 1
to 1
work 1
upon 1
it 1
Tom 1
recounted 1
and 1
adorned 1
his 1
adventures 1
They 1
were 1
a 1
vain 1
and 1
boastful 1
company 1
of 1
heroes 1
when 1
the 1
tale 1
was 1
done 1
Then 1
Tom 1
hid 1
himself 1
away 1
in 1
a 1
shady 1
nook 1
to 1
sleep 1
till 1
noon 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
pirates 1
got 1
ready 1
to 1
fish 1
and 1
explore 1
CHAPTER 1
XVI 1
AFTER 1
dinner 1
all 1
the 1
gang 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
hunt 1
for 1
turtle 1
eggs 1
on 1
the 1
bar 1
They 1
went 1
about 1
poking 1
sticks 1
into 1
the 1
sand 1
and 1
when 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
soft 1
place 1
they 1
went 1
down 1
on 1
their 1
knees 1
and 1
dug 1
with 1
their 1
hands 1
Sometimes 1
they 1
would 1
take 1
fifty 1
or 1
sixty 1
eggs 1
out 1
of 1
one 1
hole 1
They 1
were 1
perfectly 1
round 1
white 1
things 1
a 1
trifle 1
smaller 1
than 1
an 1
English 1
walnut 1
They 1
had 1
a 1
famous 1
fried 1
egg 1
feast 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
another 1
on 1
Friday 1
morning 1
After 1
breakfast 1
they 1
went 1
whooping 1
and 1
prancing 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
bar 1
and 1
chased 1
each 1
other 1
round 1
and 1
round 1
shedding 1
clothes 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
until 1
they 1
were 1
naked 1
and 1
then 1
continued 1
the 1
frolic 1
far 1
away 1
up 1
the 1
shoal 1
water 1
of 1
the 1
bar 1
against 1
the 1
stiff 1
current 1
which 1
latter 1
tripped 1
their 1
legs 1
from 1
under 1
them 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
and 1
greatly 1
increased 1
the 1
fun 1
And 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
stooped 1
in 1
a 1
group 1
and 1
splashed 1
water 1
in 1
each 1
other 1
s 1
faces 1
with 1
their 1
palms 1
gradually 1
approaching 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
averted 1
faces 1
to 1
avoid 1
the 1
strangling 1
sprays 1
and 1
finally 1
gripping 1
and 1
struggling 1
till 1
the 1
best 1
man 1
ducked 1
his 1
neighbor 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
all 1
went 1
under 1
in 1
a 1
tangle 1
of 1
white 1
legs 1
and 1
arms 1
and 1
came 1
up 1
blowing 1
sputtering 1
laughing 1
and 1
gasping 1
for 1
breath 1
at 1
one 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
When 1
they 1
were 1
well 1
exhausted 1
they 1
would 1
run 1
out 1
and 1
sprawl 1
on 1
the 1
dry 1
hot 1
sand 1
and 1
lie 1
there 1
and 1
cover 1
themselves 1
up 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
break 1
for 1
the 1
water 1
again 1
and 1
go 1
through 1
the 1
original 1
performance 1
once 1
more 1
Finally 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
their 1
naked 1
skin 1
represented 1
flesh 1
colored 1
tights 1
very 1
fairly 1
so 1
they 1
drew 1
a 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
sand 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
circus 1
with 1
three 1
clowns 1
in 1
it 1
for 1
none 1
would 1
yield 1
this 1
proudest 1
post 1
to 1
his 1
neighbor 1
Next 1
they 1
got 1
their 1
marbles 1
and 1
played 1
knucks 1
and 1
ringtaw 1
and 1
keeps 1
till 1
that 1
amusement 1
grew 1
stale 1
Then 1
Joe 1
and 1
Huck 1
had 1
another 1
swim 1
but 1
Tom 1
would 1
not 1
venture 1
because 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
in 1
kicking 1
off 1
his 1
trousers 1
he 1
had 1
kicked 1
his 1
string 1
of 1
rattlesnake 1
rattles 1
off 1
his 1
ankle 1
and 1
he 1
wondered 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
escaped 1
cramp 1
so 1
long 1
without 1
the 1
protection 1
of 1
this 1
mysterious 1
charm 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
venture 1
again 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
found 1
it 1
and 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
the 1
other 1
boys 1
were 1
tired 1
and 1
ready 1
to 1
rest 1
They 1
gradually 1
wandered 1
apart 1
dropped 1
into 1
the 1
dumps 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
gazing 1
longingly 1
across 1
the 1
wide 1
river 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
village 1
lay 1
drowsing 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
Tom 1
found 1
himself 1
writing 1
BECKY 1
in 1
the 1
sand 1
with 1
his 1
big 1
toe 1
he 1
scratched 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
was 1
angry 1
with 1
himself 1
for 1
his 1
weakness 1
But 1
he 1
wrote 1
it 1
again 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
it 1
He 1
erased 1
it 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
took 1
himself 1
out 1
of 1
temptation 1
by 1
driving 1
the 1
other 1
boys 1
together 1
and 1
joining 1
them 1
But 1
Joe 1
s 1
spirits 1
had 1
gone 1
down 1
almost 1
beyond 1
resurrection 1
He 1
was 1
so 1
homesick 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
endure 1
the 1
misery 1
of 1
it 1
The 1
tears 1
lay 1
very 1
near 1
the 1
surface 1
Huck 1
was 1
melancholy 1
too 1
Tom 1
was 1
downhearted 1
but 1
tried 1
hard 1
not 1
to 1
show 1
it 1
He 1
had 1
a 1
secret 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
ready 1
to 1
tell 1
yet 1
but 1
if 1
this 1
mutinous 1
depression 1
was 1
not 1
broken 1
up 1
soon 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
bring 1
it 1
out 1
He 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
great 1
show 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
I 1
bet 1
there 1
s 1
been 1
pirates 1
on 1
this 1
island 1
before 1
boys 1
We 1
ll 1
explore 1
it 1
again 1
They 1
ve 1
hid 1
treasures 1
here 1
somewhere 1
How 1
d 1
you 1
feel 1
to 1
light 1
on 1
a 1
rotten 1
chest 1
full 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
hey 1
But 1
it 1
roused 1
only 1
faint 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
faded 1
out 1
with 1
no 1
reply 1
Tom 1
tried 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
other 1
seductions 1
but 1
they 1
failed 1
too 1
It 1
was 1
discouraging 1
work 1
Joe 1
sat 1
poking 1
up 1
the 1
sand 1
with 1
a 1
stick 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
gloomy 1
Finally 1
he 1
said 1
Oh 1
boys 1
let 1
s 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
It 1
s 1
so 1
lonesome 1
Oh 1
no 1
Joe 1
you 1
ll 1
feel 1
better 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
said 1
Tom 1
Just 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
fishing 1
that 1
s 1
here 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
fishing 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
But 1
Joe 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
such 1
another 1
swimming 1
place 1
anywhere 1
Swimming 1
s 1
no 1
good 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
care 1
for 1
it 1
somehow 1
when 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
anybody 1
to 1
say 1
I 1
sha 1
n 1
t 1
go 1
in 1
I 1
mean 1
to 1
go 1
home 1
Oh 1
shucks 1
Baby 1
You 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
your 1
mother 1
I 1
reckon 1
Yes 1
I 1
do 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
you 1
would 1
too 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
one 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
any 1
more 1
baby 1
than 1
you 1
are 1
And 1
Joe 1
snuffled 1
a 1
little 1
Well 1
we 1
ll 1
let 1
the 1
crybaby 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
his 1
mother 1
won 1
t 1
we 1
Huck 1
Poor 1
thing 1
does 1
it 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
its 1
mother 1
And 1
so 1
it 1
shall 1
You 1
like 1
it 1
here 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
Huck 1
We 1
ll 1
stay 1
won 1
t 1
we 1
Huck 1
said 1
Y 1
e 1
s 1
without 1
any 1
heart 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
ll 1
never 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
live 1
said 1
Joe 1
rising 1
There 1
now 1
And 1
he 1
moved 1
moodily 1
away 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
dress 1
himself 1
Who 1
cares 1
said 1
Tom 1
Nobody 1
wants 1
you 1
to 1
Go 1
long 1
home 1
and 1
get 1
laughed 1
at 1
Oh 1
you 1
re 1
a 1
nice 1
pirate 1
Huck 1
and 1
me 1
ain 1
t 1
crybabies 1
We 1
ll 1
stay 1
won 1
t 1
we 1
Huck 1
Let 1
him 1
go 1
if 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
can 1
get 1
along 1
without 1
him 1
per 1
aps 1
But 1
Tom 1
was 1
uneasy 1
nevertheless 1
and 1
was 1
alarmed 1
to 1
see 1
Joe 1
go 1
sullenly 1
on 1
with 1
his 1
dressing 1
And 1
then 1
it 1
was 1
discomforting 1
to 1
see 1
Huck 1
eying 1
Joe 1
s 1
preparations 1
so 1
wistfully 1
and 1
keeping 1
up 1
such 1
an 1
ominous 1
silence 1
Presently 1
without 1
a 1
parting 1
word 1
Joe 1
began 1
to 1
wade 1
off 1
toward 1
the 1
Illinois 1
shore 1
Tom 1
s 1
heart 1
began 1
to 1
sink 1
He 1
glanced 1
at 1
Huck 1
Huck 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
the 1
look 1
and 1
dropped 1
his 1
eyes 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
too 1
Tom 1
It 1
was 1
getting 1
so 1
lonesome 1
anyway 1
and 1
now 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
worse 1
Let 1
s 1
us 1
go 1
too 1
Tom 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
You 1
can 1
all 1
go 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
I 1
mean 1
to 1
stay 1
Tom 1
I 1
better 1
go 1
Well 1
go 1
long 1
who 1
s 1
hendering 1
you 1
Huck 1
began 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
his 1
scattered 1
clothes 1
He 1
said 1
Tom 1
I 1
wisht 1
you 1
d 1
come 1
too 1
Now 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
over 1
We 1
ll 1
wait 1
for 1
you 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
shore 1
Well 1
you 1
ll 1
wait 1
a 1
blame 1
long 1
time 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
Huck 1
started 1
sorrowfully 1
away 1
and 1
Tom 1
stood 1
looking 1
after 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
desire 1
tugging 1
at 1
his 1
heart 1
to 1
yield 1
his 1
pride 1
and 1
go 1
along 1
too 1
He 1
hoped 1
the 1
boys 1
would 1
stop 1
but 1
they 1
still 1
waded 1
slowly 1
on 1
It 1
suddenly 1
dawned 1
on 1
Tom 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
become 1
very 1
lonely 1
and 1
still 1
He 1
made 1
one 1
final 1
struggle 1
with 1
his 1
pride 1
and 1
then 1
darted 1
after 1
his 1
comrades 1
yelling 1
Wait 1
Wait 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
They 1
presently 1
stopped 1
and 1
turned 1
around 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
where 1
they 1
were 1
he 1
began 1
unfolding 1
his 1
secret 1
and 1
they 1
listened 1
moodily 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
saw 1
the 1
point 1
he 1
was 1
driving 1
at 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
set 1
up 1
a 1
warwhoop 1
of 1
applause 1
and 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
splendid 1
and 1
said 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
told 1
them 1
at 1
first 1
they 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
started 1
away 1
He 1
made 1
a 1
plausible 1
excuse 1
but 1
his 1
real 1
reason 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
fear 1
that 1
not 1
even 1
the 1
secret 1
would 1
keep 1
them 1
with 1
him 1
any 1
very 1
great 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
had 1
meant 1
to 1
hold 1
it 1
in 1
reserve 1
as 1
a 1
last 1
seduction 1
The 1
lads 1
came 1
gayly 1
back 1
and 1
went 1
at 1
their 1
sports 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
will 1
chattering 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
about 1
Tom 1
s 1
stupendous 1
plan 1
and 1
admiring 1
the 1
genius 1
of 1
it 1
After 1
a 1
dainty 1
egg 1
and 1
fish 1
dinner 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
learn 1
to 1
smoke 1
now 1
Joe 1
caught 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
and 1
said 1
he 1
would 1
like 1
to 1
try 1
too 1
So 1
Huck 1
made 1
pipes 1
and 1
filled 1
them 1
These 1
novices 1
had 1
never 1
smoked 1
anything 1
before 1
but 1
cigars 1
made 1
of 1
grapevine 1
and 1
they 1
bit 1
the 1
tongue 1
and 1
were 1
not 1
considered 1
manly 1
anyway 1
Now 1
they 1
stretched 1
themselves 1
out 1
on 1
their 1
elbows 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
puff 1
charily 1
and 1
with 1
slender 1
confidence 1
The 1
smoke 1
had 1
an 1
unpleasant 1
taste 1
and 1
they 1
gagged 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
Tom 1
said 1
Why 1
it 1
s 1
just 1
as 1
easy 1
If 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
knowed 1
this 1
was 1
all 1
I 1
d 1
a 1
learnt 1
long 1
ago 1
So 1
would 1
I 1
said 1
Joe 1
It 1
s 1
just 1
nothing 1
Why 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
I 1
ve 1
looked 1
at 1
people 1
smoking 1
and 1
thought 1
well 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
that 1
but 1
I 1
never 1
thought 1
I 1
could 1
said 1
Tom 1
That 1
s 1
just 1
the 1
way 1
with 1
me 1
hain 1
t 1
it 1
Huck 1
You 1
ve 1
heard 1
me 1
talk 1
just 1
that 1
way 1
haven 1
t 1
you 1
Huck 1
I 1
ll 1
leave 1
it 1
to 1
Huck 1
if 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
Yes 1
heaps 1
of 1
times 1
said 1
Huck 1
Well 1
I 1
have 1
too 1
said 1
Tom 1
oh 1
hundreds 1
of 1
times 1
Once 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
slaughter 1
house 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
remember 1
Huck 1
Bob 1
Tanner 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
Johnny 1
Miller 1
and 1
Jeff 1
Thatcher 1
when 1
I 1
said 1
it 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
remember 1
Huck 1
bout 1
me 1
saying 1
that 1
Yes 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
said 1
Huck 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
I 1
lost 1
a 1
white 1
alley 1
No 1
twas 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
There 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
so 1
said 1
Tom 1
Huck 1
recollects 1
it 1
I 1
bleeve 1
I 1
could 1
smoke 1
this 1
pipe 1
all 1
day 1
said 1
Joe 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
feel 1
sick 1
Neither 1
do 1
I 1
said 1
Tom 1
I 1
could 1
smoke 1
it 1
all 1
day 1
But 1
I 1
bet 1
you 1
Jeff 1
Thatcher 1
couldn 1
t 1
Jeff 1
Thatcher 1
Why 1
he 1
d 1
keel 1
over 1
just 1
with 1
two 1
draws 1
Just 1
let 1
him 1
try 1
it 1
once 1
He 1
d 1
see 1
I 1
bet 1
he 1
would 1
And 1
Johnny 1
Miller 1
I 1
wish 1
could 1
see 1
Johnny 1
Miller 1
tackle 1
it 1
once 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
I 1
said 1
Joe 1
Why 1
I 1
bet 1
you 1
Johnny 1
Miller 1
couldn 1
t 1
any 1
more 1
do 1
this 1
than 1
nothing 1
Just 1
one 1
little 1
snifter 1
would 1
fetch 1
him 1
Deed 1
it 1
would 1
Joe 1
Say 1
I 1
wish 1
the 1
boys 1
could 1
see 1
us 1
now 1
So 1
do 1
I 1
Say 1
boys 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
some 1
time 1
when 1
they 1
re 1
around 1
I 1
ll 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
say 1
Joe 1
got 1
a 1
pipe 1
I 1
want 1
a 1
smoke 1
And 1
you 1
ll 1
say 1
kind 1
of 1
careless 1
like 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
anything 1
you 1
ll 1
say 1
Yes 1
I 1
got 1
my 1
old 1
pipe 1
and 1
another 1
one 1
but 1
my 1
tobacker 1
ain 1
t 1
very 1
good 1
And 1
I 1
ll 1
say 1
Oh 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
if 1
it 1
s 1
strong 1
enough 1
And 1
then 1
you 1
ll 1
out 1
with 1
the 1
pipes 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
light 1
up 1
just 1
as 1
ca 1
m 1
and 1
then 1
just 1
see 1
em 1
look 1
By 1
jings 1
that 1
ll 1
be 1
gay 1
Tom 1
I 1
wish 1
it 1
was 1
now 1
So 1
do 1
I 1
And 1
when 1
we 1
tell 1
em 1
we 1
learned 1
when 1
we 1
was 1
off 1
pirating 1
won 1
t 1
they 1
wish 1
they 1
d 1
been 1
along 1
Oh 1
I 1
reckon 1
not 1
I 1
ll 1
just 1
bet 1
they 1
will 1
So 1
the 1
talk 1
ran 1
on 1
But 1
presently 1
it 1
began 1
to 1
flag 1
a 1
trifle 1
and 1
grow 1
disjointed 1
The 1
silences 1
widened 1
the 1
expectoration 1
marvellously 1
increased 1
Every 1
pore 1
inside 1
the 1
boys 1
cheeks 1
became 1
a 1
spouting 1
fountain 1
they 1
could 1
scarcely 1
bail 1
out 1
the 1
cellars 1
under 1
their 1
tongues 1
fast 1
enough 1
to 1
prevent 1
an 1
inundation 1
little 1
overflowings 1
down 1
their 1
throats 1
occurred 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
all 1
they 1
could 1
do 1
and 1
sudden 1
retchings 1
followed 1
every 1
time 1
Both 1
boys 1
were 1
looking 1
very 1
pale 1
and 1
miserable 1
now 1
Joe 1
s 1
pipe 1
dropped 1
from 1
his 1
nerveless 1
fingers 1
Tom 1
s 1
followed 1
Both 1
fountains 1
were 1
going 1
furiously 1
and 1
both 1
pumps 1
bailing 1
with 1
might 1
and 1
main 1
Joe 1
said 1
feebly 1
I 1
ve 1
lost 1
my 1
knife 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
better 1
go 1
and 1
find 1
it 1
Tom 1
said 1
with 1
quivering 1
lips 1
and 1
halting 1
utterance 1
I 1
ll 1
help 1
you 1
You 1
go 1
over 1
that 1
way 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
hunt 1
around 1
by 1
the 1
spring 1
No 1
you 1
needn 1
t 1
come 1
Huck 1
we 1
can 1
find 1
it 1
So 1
Huck 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
waited 1
an 1
hour 1
Then 1
he 1
found 1
it 1
lonesome 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
find 1
his 1
comrades 1
They 1
were 1
wide 1
apart 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
both 1
very 1
pale 1
both 1
fast 1
asleep 1
But 1
something 1
informed 1
him 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
any 1
trouble 1
they 1
had 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
it 1
They 1
were 1
not 1
talkative 1
at 1
supper 1
that 1
night 1
They 1
had 1
a 1
humble 1
look 1
and 1
when 1
Huck 1
prepared 1
his 1
pipe 1
after 1
the 1
meal 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
prepare 1
theirs 1
they 1
said 1
no 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
feeling 1
very 1
well 1
something 1
they 1
ate 1
at 1
dinner 1
had 1
disagreed 1
with 1
them 1
About 1
midnight 1
Joe 1
awoke 1
and 1
called 1
the 1
boys 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
brooding 1
oppressiveness 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
bode 1
something 1
The 1
boys 1
huddled 1
themselves 1
together 1
and 1
sought 1
the 1
friendly 1
companionship 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
though 1
the 1
dull 1
dead 1
heat 1
of 1
the 1
breathless 1
atmosphere 1
was 1
stifling 1
They 1
sat 1
still 1
intent 1
and 1
waiting 1
The 1
solemn 1
hush 1
continued 1
Beyond 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
fire 1
everything 1
was 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
darkness 1
Presently 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
quivering 1
glow 1
that 1
vaguely 1
revealed 1
the 1
foliage 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
vanished 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
another 1
came 1
a 1
little 1
stronger 1
Then 1
another 1
Then 1
a 1
faint 1
moan 1
came 1
sighing 1
through 1
the 1
branches 1
of 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
felt 1
a 1
fleeting 1
breath 1
upon 1
their 1
cheeks 1
and 1
shuddered 1
with 1
the 1
fancy 1
that 1
the 1
Spirit 1
of 1
the 1
Night 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
pause 1
Now 1
a 1
weird 1
flash 1
turned 1
night 1
into 1
day 1
and 1
showed 1
every 1
little 1
grassblade 1
separate 1
and 1
distinct 1
that 1
grew 1
about 1
their 1
feet 1
And 1
it 1
showed 1
three 1
white 1
startled 1
faces 1
too 1
A 1
deep 1
peal 1
of 1
thunder 1
went 1
rolling 1
and 1
tumbling 1
down 1
the 1
heavens 1
and 1
lost 1
itself 1
in 1
sullen 1
rumblings 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
A 1
sweep 1
of 1
chilly 1
air 1
passed 1
by 1
rustling 1
all 1
the 1
leaves 1
and 1
snowing 1
the 1
flaky 1
ashes 1
broadcast 1
about 1
the 1
fire 1
Another 1
fierce 1
glare 1
lit 1
up 1
the 1
forest 1
and 1
an 1
instant 1
crash 1
followed 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
rend 1
the 1
treetops 1
right 1
over 1
the 1
boys 1
heads 1
They 1
clung 1
together 1
in 1
terror 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
gloom 1
that 1
followed 1
A 1
few 1
big 1
raindrops 1
fell 1
pattering 1
upon 1
the 1
leaves 1
Quick 1
boys 1
go 1
for 1
the 1
tent 1
exclaimed 1
Tom 1
They 1
sprang 1
away 1
stumbling 1
over 1
roots 1
and 1
among 1
vines 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
no 1
two 1
plunging 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
direction 1
A 1
furious 1
blast 1
roared 1
through 1
the 1
trees 1
making 1
everything 1
sing 1
as 1
it 1
went 1
One 1
blinding 1
flash 1
after 1
another 1
came 1
and 1
peal 1
on 1
peal 1
of 1
deafening 1
thunder 1
And 1
now 1
a 1
drenching 1
rain 1
poured 1
down 1
and 1
the 1
rising 1
hurricane 1
drove 1
it 1
in 1
sheets 1
along 1
the 1
ground 1
The 1
boys 1
cried 1
out 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
but 1
the 1
roaring 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
booming 1
thunderblasts 1
drowned 1
their 1
voices 1
utterly 1
However 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
they 1
straggled 1
in 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
took 1
shelter 1
under 1
the 1
tent 1
cold 1
scared 1
and 1
streaming 1
with 1
water 1
but 1
to 1
have 1
company 1
in 1
misery 1
seemed 1
something 1
to 1
be 1
grateful 1
for 1
They 1
could 1
not 1
talk 1
the 1
old 1
sail 1
flapped 1
so 1
furiously 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
other 1
noises 1
would 1
have 1
allowed 1
them 1
The 1
tempest 1
rose 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
sail 1
tore 1
loose 1
from 1
its 1
fastenings 1
and 1
went 1
winging 1
away 1
on 1
the 1
blast 1
The 1
boys 1
seized 1
each 1
others 1
hands 1
and 1
fled 1
with 1
many 1
tumblings 1
and 1
bruises 1
to 1
the 1
shelter 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
oak 1
that 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
riverbank 1
Now 1
the 1
battle 1
was 1
at 1
its 1
highest 1
Under 1
the 1
ceaseless 1
conflagration 1
of 1
lightning 1
that 1
flamed 1
in 1
the 1
skies 1
everything 1
below 1
stood 1
out 1
in 1
cleancut 1
and 1
shadowless 1
distinctness 1
the 1
bending 1
trees 1
the 1
billowy 1
river 1
white 1
with 1
foam 1
the 1
driving 1
spray 1
of 1
spumeflakes 1
the 1
dim 1
outlines 1
of 1
the 1
high 1
bluffs 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
glimpsed 1
through 1
the 1
drifting 1
cloudrack 1
and 1
the 1
slanting 1
veil 1
of 1
rain 1
Every 1
little 1
while 1
some 1
giant 1
tree 1
yielded 1
the 1
fight 1
and 1
fell 1
crashing 1
through 1
the 1
younger 1
growth 1
and 1
the 1
unflagging 1
thunderpeals 1
came 1
now 1
in 1
ear 1
splitting 1
explosive 1
bursts 1
keen 1
and 1
sharp 1
and 1
unspeakably 1
appalling 1
The 1
storm 1
culminated 1
in 1
one 1
matchless 1
effort 1
that 1
seemed 1
likely 1
to 1
tear 1
the 1
island 1
to 1
pieces 1
burn 1
it 1
up 1
drown 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
treetops 1
blow 1
it 1
away 1
and 1
deafen 1
every 1
creature 1
in 1
it 1
all 1
at 1
one 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
moment 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
wild 1
night 1
for 1
homeless 1
young 1
heads 1
to 1
be 1
out 1
in 1
But 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
battle 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
the 1
forces 1
retired 1
with 1
weaker 1
and 1
weaker 1
threatenings 1
and 1
grumblings 1
and 1
peace 1
resumed 1
her 1
sway 1
The 1
boys 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
awed 1
but 1
they 1
found 1
there 1
was 1
still 1
something 1
to 1
be 1
thankful 1
for 1
because 1
the 1
great 1
sycamore 1
the 1
shelter 1
of 1
their 1
beds 1
was 1
a 1
ruin 1
now 1
blasted 1
by 1
the 1
lightnings 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
not 1
under 1
it 1
when 1
the 1
catastrophe 1
happened 1
Everything 1
in 1
camp 1
was 1
drenched 1
the 1
campfire 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
they 1
were 1
but 1
heedless 1
lads 1
like 1
their 1
generation 1
and 1
had 1
made 1
no 1
provision 1
against 1
rain 1
Here 1
was 1
matter 1
for 1
dismay 1
for 1
they 1
were 1
soaked 1
through 1
and 1
chilled 1
They 1
were 1
eloquent 1
in 1
their 1
distress 1
but 1
they 1
presently 1
discovered 1
that 1
the 1
fire 1
had 1
eaten 1
so 1
far 1
up 1
under 1
the 1
great 1
log 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
built 1
against 1
where 1
it 1
curved 1
upward 1
and 1
separated 1
itself 1
from 1
the 1
ground 1
that 1
a 1
handbreadth 1
or 1
so 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
escaped 1
wetting 1
so 1
they 1
patiently 1
wrought 1
until 1
with 1
shreds 1
and 1
bark 1
gathered 1
from 1
the 1
under 1
sides 1
of 1
sheltered 1
logs 1
they 1
coaxed 1
the 1
fire 1
to 1
burn 1
again 1
Then 1
they 1
piled 1
on 1
great 1
dead 1
boughs 1
till 1
they 1
had 1
a 1
roaring 1
furnace 1
and 1
were 1
gladhearted 1
once 1
more 1
They 1
dried 1
their 1
boiled 1
ham 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
feast 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
they 1
sat 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
expanded 1
and 1
glorified 1
their 1
midnight 1
adventure 1
until 1
morning 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
dry 1
spot 1
to 1
sleep 1
on 1
anywhere 1
around 1
As 1
the 1
sun 1
began 1
to 1
steal 1
in 1
upon 1
the 1
boys 1
drowsiness 1
came 1
over 1
them 1
and 1
they 1
went 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
sandbar 1
and 1
lay 1
down 1
to 1
sleep 1
They 1
got 1
scorched 1
out 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
drearily 1
set 1
about 1
getting 1
breakfast 1
After 1
the 1
meal 1
they 1
felt 1
rusty 1
and 1
stiff 1
jointed 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
homesick 1
once 1
more 1
Tom 1
saw 1
the 1
signs 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
cheering 1
up 1
the 1
pirates 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
But 1
they 1
cared 1
nothing 1
for 1
marbles 1
or 1
circus 1
or 1
swimming 1
or 1
anything 1
He 1
reminded 1
them 1
of 1
the 1
imposing 1
secret 1
and 1
raised 1
a 1
ray 1
of 1
cheer 1
While 1
it 1
lasted 1
he 1
got 1
them 1
interested 1
in 1
a 1
new 1
device 1
This 1
was 1
to 1
knock 1
off 1
being 1
pirates 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
and 1
be 1
Indians 1
for 1
a 1
change 1
They 1
were 1
attracted 1
by 1
this 1
idea 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
long 1
before 1
they 1
were 1
stripped 1
and 1
striped 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
heel 1
with 1
black 1
mud 1
like 1
so 1
many 1
zebras 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
chiefs 1
of 1
course 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
went 1
tearing 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
to 1
attack 1
an 1
English 1
settlement 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
separated 1
into 1
three 1
hostile 1
tribes 1
and 1
darted 1
upon 1
each 1
other 1
from 1
ambush 1
with 1
dreadful 1
warwhoops 1
and 1
killed 1
and 1
scalped 1
each 1
other 1
by 1
thousands 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
gory 1
day 1
Consequently 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
extremely 1
satisfactory 1
one 1
They 1
assembled 1
in 1
camp 1
toward 1
suppertime 1
hungry 1
and 1
happy 1
but 1
now 1
a 1
difficulty 1
arose 1
hostile 1
Indians 1
could 1
not 1
break 1
the 1
bread 1
of 1
hospitality 1
together 1
without 1
first 1
making 1
peace 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
simple 1
impossibility 1
without 1
smoking 1
a 1
pipe 1
of 1
peace 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
process 1
that 1
ever 1
they 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
Two 1
of 1
the 1
savages 1
almost 1
wished 1
they 1
had 1
remained 1
pirates 1
However 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
other 1
way 1
so 1
with 1
such 1
show 1
of 1
cheerfulness 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
muster 1
they 1
called 1
for 1
the 1
pipe 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
whiff 1
as 1
it 1
passed 1
in 1
due 1
form 1
And 1
behold 1
they 1
were 1
glad 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
into 1
savagery 1
for 1
they 1
had 1
gained 1
something 1
they 1
found 1
that 1
they 1
could 1
now 1
smoke 1
a 1
little 1
without 1
having 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
hunt 1
for 1
a 1
lost 1
knife 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
get 1
sick 1
enough 1
to 1
be 1
seriously 1
uncomfortable 1
They 1
were 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
fool 1
away 1
this 1
high 1
promise 1
for 1
lack 1
of 1
effort 1
No 1
they 1
practised 1
cautiously 1
after 1
supper 1
with 1
right 1
fair 1
success 1
and 1
so 1
they 1
spent 1
a 1
jubilant 1
evening 1
They 1
were 1
prouder 1
and 1
happier 1
in 1
their 1
new 1
acquirement 1
than 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
scalping 1
and 1
skinning 1
of 1
the 1
Six 1
Nations 1
We 1
will 1
leave 1
them 1
to 1
smoke 1
and 1
chatter 1
and 1
brag 1
since 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
further 1
use 1
for 1
them 1
at 1
present 1
CHAPTER 1
XVII 1
BUT 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
hilarity 1
in 1
the 1
little 1
town 1
that 1
same 1
tranquil 1
Saturday 1
afternoon 1
The 1
Harpers 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
family 1
were 1
being 1
put 1
into 1
mourning 1
with 1
great 1
grief 1
and 1
many 1
tears 1
An 1
unusual 1
quiet 1
possessed 1
the 1
village 1
although 1
it 1
was 1
ordinarily 1
quiet 1
enough 1
in 1
all 1
conscience 1
The 1
villagers 1
conducted 1
their 1
concerns 1
with 1
an 1
absent 1
air 1
and 1
talked 1
little 1
but 1
they 1
sighed 1
often 1
The 1
Saturday 1
holiday 1
seemed 1
a 1
burden 1
to 1
the 1
children 1
They 1
had 1
no 1
heart 1
in 1
their 1
sports 1
and 1
gradually 1
gave 1
them 1
up 1
In 1
the 1
afternoon 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
found 1
herself 1
moping 1
about 1
the 1
deserted 1
schoolhouse 1
yard 1
and 1
feeling 1
very 1
melancholy 1
But 1
she 1
found 1
nothing 1
there 1
to 1
comfort 1
her 1
She 1
soliloquized 1
Oh 1
if 1
I 1
only 1
had 1
a 1
brass 1
andiron 1
knob 1
again 1
But 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
anything 1
now 1
to 1
remember 1
him 1
by 1
And 1
she 1
choked 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
sob 1
Presently 1
she 1
stopped 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
It 1
was 1
right 1
here 1
Oh 1
if 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
do 1
over 1
again 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
say 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
But 1
he 1
s 1
gone 1
now 1
I 1
ll 1
never 1
never 1
never 1
see 1
him 1
any 1
more 1
This 1
thought 1
broke 1
her 1
down 1
and 1
she 1
wandered 1
away 1
with 1
tears 1
rolling 1
down 1
her 1
cheeks 1
Then 1
quite 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
playmates 1
of 1
Tom 1
s 1
and 1
Joe 1
s 1
came 1
by 1
and 1
stood 1
looking 1
over 1
the 1
paling 1
fence 1
and 1
talking 1
in 1
reverent 1
tones 1
of 1
how 1
Tom 1
did 1
so 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
last 1
time 1
they 1
saw 1
him 1
and 1
how 1
Joe 1
said 1
this 1
and 1
that 1
small 1
trifle 1
pregnant 1
with 1
awful 1
prophecy 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
easily 1
see 1
now 1
and 1
each 1
speaker 1
pointed 1
out 1
the 1
exact 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
lost 1
lads 1
stood 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
then 1
added 1
something 1
like 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
standing 1
just 1
so 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
now 1
and 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
him 1
I 1
was 1
as 1
close 1
as 1
that 1
and 1
he 1
smiled 1
just 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
then 1
something 1
seemed 1
to 1
go 1
all 1
over 1
me 1
like 1
awful 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
thought 1
what 1
it 1
meant 1
of 1
course 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
see 1
now 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
dispute 1
about 1
who 1
saw 1
the 1
dead 1
boys 1
last 1
in 1
life 1
and 1
many 1
claimed 1
that 1
dismal 1
distinction 1
and 1
offered 1
evidences 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
tampered 1
with 1
by 1
the 1
witness 1
and 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
ultimately 1
decided 1
who 1
did 1
see 1
the 1
departed 1
last 1
and 1
exchanged 1
the 1
last 1
words 1
with 1
them 1
the 1
lucky 1
parties 1
took 1
upon 1
themselves 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
sacred 1
importance 1
and 1
were 1
gaped 1
at 1
and 1
envied 1
by 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
One 1
poor 1
chap 1
who 1
had 1
no 1
other 1
grandeur 1
to 1
offer 1
said 1
with 1
tolerably 1
manifest 1
pride 1
in 1
the 1
remembrance 1
Well 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
he 1
licked 1
me 1
once 1
But 1
that 1
bid 1
for 1
glory 1
was 1
a 1
failure 1
Most 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
could 1
say 1
that 1
and 1
so 1
that 1
cheapened 1
the 1
distinction 1
too 1
much 1
The 1
group 1
loitered 1
away 1
still 1
recalling 1
memories 1
of 1
the 1
lost 1
heroes 1
in 1
awed 1
voices 1
When 1
the 1
Sunday 1
school 1
hour 1
was 1
finished 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
bell 1
began 1
to 1
toll 1
instead 1
of 1
ringing 1
in 1
the 1
usual 1
way 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
still 1
Sabbath 1
and 1
the 1
mournful 1
sound 1
seemed 1
in 1
keeping 1
with 1
the 1
musing 1
hush 1
that 1
lay 1
upon 1
nature 1
The 1
villagers 1
began 1
to 1
gather 1
loitering 1
a 1
moment 1
in 1
the 1
vestibule 1
to 1
converse 1
in 1
whispers 1
about 1
the 1
sad 1
event 1
But 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
whispering 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
only 1
the 1
funereal 1
rustling 1
of 1
dresses 1
as 1
the 1
women 1
gathered 1
to 1
their 1
seats 1
disturbed 1
the 1
silence 1
there 1
None 1
could 1
remember 1
when 1
the 1
little 1
church 1
had 1
been 1
so 1
full 1
before 1
There 1
was 1
finally 1
a 1
waiting 1
pause 1
an 1
expectant 1
dumbness 1
and 1
then 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
entered 1
followed 1
by 1
Sid 1
and 1
Mary 1
and 1
they 1
by 1
the 1
Harper 1
family 1
all 1
in 1
deep 1
black 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
congregation 1
the 1
old 1
minister 1
as 1
well 1
rose 1
reverently 1
and 1
stood 1
until 1
the 1
mourners 1
were 1
seated 1
in 1
the 1
front 1
pew 1
There 1
was 1
another 1
communing 1
silence 1
broken 1
at 1
intervals 1
by 1
muffled 1
sobs 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
minister 1
spread 1
his 1
hands 1
abroad 1
and 1
prayed 1
A 1
moving 1
hymn 1
was 1
sung 1
and 1
the 1
text 1
followed 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
Resurrection 1
and 1
the 1
Life 1
As 1
the 1
service 1
proceeded 1
the 1
clergyman 1
drew 1
such 1
pictures 1
of 1
the 1
graces 1
the 1
winning 1
ways 1
and 1
the 1
rare 1
promise 1
of 1
the 1
lost 1
lads 1
that 1
every 1
soul 1
there 1
thinking 1
he 1
recognized 1
these 1
pictures 1
felt 1
a 1
pang 1
in 1
remembering 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
persistently 1
blinded 1
himself 1
to 1
them 1
always 1
before 1
and 1
had 1
as 1
persistently 1
seen 1
only 1
faults 1
and 1
flaws 1
in 1
the 1
poor 1
boys 1
The 1
minister 1
related 1
many 1
a 1
touching 1
incident 1
in 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
the 1
departed 1
too 1
which 1
illustrated 1
their 1
sweet 1
generous 1
natures 1
and 1
the 1
people 1
could 1
easily 1
see 1
now 1
how 1
noble 1
and 1
beautiful 1
those 1
episodes 1
were 1
and 1
remembered 1
with 1
grief 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
they 1
occurred 1
they 1
had 1
seemed 1
rank 1
rascalities 1
well 1
deserving 1
of 1
the 1
cowhide 1
The 1
congregation 1
became 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
moved 1
as 1
the 1
pathetic 1
tale 1
went 1
on 1
till 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
whole 1
company 1
broke 1
down 1
and 1
joined 1
the 1
weeping 1
mourners 1
in 1
a 1
chorus 1
of 1
anguished 1
sobs 1
the 1
preacher 1
himself 1
giving 1
way 1
to 1
his 1
feelings 1
and 1
crying 1
in 1
the 1
pulpit 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
rustle 1
in 1
the 1
gallery 1
which 1
nobody 1
noticed 1
a 1
moment 1
later 1
the 1
church 1
door 1
creaked 1
the 1
minister 1
raised 1
his 1
streaming 1
eyes 1
above 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
stood 1
transfixed 1
First 1
one 1
and 1
then 1
another 1
pair 1
of 1
eyes 1
followed 1
the 1
minister 1
s 1
and 1
then 1
almost 1
with 1
one 1
impulse 1
the 1
congregation 1
rose 1
and 1
stared 1
while 1
the 1
three 1
dead 1
boys 1
came 1
marching 1
up 1
the 1
aisle 1
Tom 1
in 1
the 1
lead 1
Joe 1
next 1
and 1
Huck 1
a 1
ruin 1
of 1
drooping 1
rags 1
sneaking 1
sheepishly 1
in 1
the 1
rear 1
They 1
had 1
been 1
hid 1
in 1
the 1
unused 1
gallery 1
listening 1
to 1
their 1
own 1
funeral 1
sermon 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
Mary 1
and 1
the 1
Harpers 1
threw 1
themselves 1
upon 1
their 1
restored 1
ones 1
smothered 1
them 1
with 1
kisses 1
and 1
poured 1
out 1
thanksgivings 1
while 1
poor 1
Huck 1
stood 1
abashed 1
and 1
uncomfortable 1
not 1
knowing 1
exactly 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
or 1
where 1
to 1
hide 1
from 1
so 1
many 1
unwelcoming 1
eyes 1
He 1
wavered 1
and 1
started 1
to 1
slink 1
away 1
but 1
Tom 1
seized 1
him 1
and 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
fair 1
Somebody 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
Huck 1
And 1
so 1
they 1
shall 1
I 1
m 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
poor 1
motherless 1
thing 1
And 1
the 1
loving 1
attentions 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
lavished 1
upon 1
him 1
were 1
the 1
one 1
thing 1
capable 1
of 1
making 1
him 1
more 1
uncomfortable 1
than 1
he 1
was 1
before 1
Suddenly 1
the 1
minister 1
shouted 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
Praise 1
God 1
from 1
whom 1
all 1
blessings 1
flow 1
sing 1
and 1
put 1
your 1
hearts 1
in 1
it 1
And 1
they 1
did 1
Old 1
Hundred 1
swelled 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
triumphant 1
burst 1
and 1
while 1
it 1
shook 1
the 1
rafters 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
the 1
Pirate 1
looked 1
around 1
upon 1
the 1
envying 1
juveniles 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
confessed 1
in 1
his 1
heart 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
proudest 1
moment 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
As 1
the 1
sold 1
congregation 1
trooped 1
out 1
they 1
said 1
they 1
would 1
almost 1
be 1
willing 1
to 1
be 1
made 1
ridiculous 1
again 1
to 1
hear 1
Old 1
Hundred 1
sung 1
like 1
that 1
once 1
more 1
Tom 1
got 1
more 1
cuffs 1
and 1
kisses 1
that 1
day 1
according 1
to 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
varying 1
moods 1
than 1
he 1
had 1
earned 1
before 1
in 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
he 1
hardly 1
knew 1
which 1
expressed 1
the 1
most 1
gratefulness 1
to 1
God 1
and 1
affection 1
for 1
himself 1
CHAPTER 1
XVIII 1
THAT 1
was 1
Tom 1
s 1
great 1
secret 1
the 1
scheme 1
to 1
return 1
home 1
with 1
his 1
brother 1
pirates 1
and 1
attend 1
their 1
own 1
funerals 1
They 1
had 1
paddled 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
Missouri 1
shore 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
at 1
dusk 1
on 1
Saturday 1
landing 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
miles 1
below 1
the 1
village 1
they 1
had 1
slept 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
at 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
till 1
nearly 1
daylight 1
and 1
had 1
then 1
crept 1
through 1
back 1
lanes 1
and 1
alleys 1
and 1
finished 1
their 1
sleep 1
in 1
the 1
gallery 1
of 1
the 1
church 1
among 1
a 1
chaos 1
of 1
invalided 1
benches 1
At 1
breakfast 1
Monday 1
morning 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
and 1
Mary 1
were 1
very 1
loving 1
to 1
Tom 1
and 1
very 1
attentive 1
to 1
his 1
wants 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
unusual 1
amount 1
of 1
talk 1
In 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
it 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
said 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
say 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
a 1
fine 1
joke 1
Tom 1
to 1
keep 1
everybody 1
suffering 1
most 1
a 1
week 1
so 1
you 1
boys 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
you 1
could 1
be 1
so 1
hard 1
hearted 1
as 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
suffer 1
so 1
If 1
you 1
could 1
come 1
over 1
on 1
a 1
log 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
your 1
funeral 1
you 1
could 1
have 1
come 1
over 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
hint 1
some 1
way 1
that 1
you 1
warn 1
t 1
dead 1
but 1
only 1
run 1
off 1
Yes 1
you 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
that 1
Tom 1
said 1
Mary 1
and 1
I 1
believe 1
you 1
would 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
Would 1
you 1
Tom 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
her 1
face 1
lighting 1
wistfully 1
Say 1
now 1
would 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
d 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Twould 1
a 1
spoiled 1
everything 1
Tom 1
I 1
hoped 1
you 1
loved 1
me 1
that 1
much 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
with 1
a 1
grieved 1
tone 1
that 1
discomforted 1
the 1
boy 1
It 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
something 1
if 1
you 1
d 1
cared 1
enough 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
Now 1
auntie 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
any 1
harm 1
pleaded 1
Mary 1
it 1
s 1
only 1
Tom 1
s 1
giddy 1
way 1
he 1
is 1
always 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
rush 1
that 1
he 1
never 1
thinks 1
of 1
anything 1
More 1
s 1
the 1
pity 1
Sid 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
And 1
Sid 1
would 1
have 1
come 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
too 1
Tom 1
you 1
ll 1
look 1
back 1
some 1
day 1
when 1
it 1
s 1
too 1
late 1
and 1
wish 1
you 1
d 1
cared 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
for 1
me 1
when 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
cost 1
you 1
so 1
little 1
Now 1
auntie 1
you 1
know 1
I 1
do 1
care 1
for 1
you 1
said 1
Tom 1
I 1
d 1
know 1
it 1
better 1
if 1
you 1
acted 1
more 1
like 1
it 1
I 1
wish 1
now 1
I 1
d 1
thought 1
said 1
Tom 1
with 1
a 1
repentant 1
tone 1
but 1
I 1
dreamt 1
about 1
you 1
anyway 1
That 1
s 1
something 1
ain 1
t 1
it 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
much 1
a 1
cat 1
does 1
that 1
much 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
better 1
than 1
nothing 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
dream 1
Why 1
Wednesday 1
night 1
I 1
dreamt 1
that 1
you 1
was 1
sitting 1
over 1
there 1
by 1
the 1
bed 1
and 1
Sid 1
was 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
woodbox 1
and 1
Mary 1
next 1
to 1
him 1
Well 1
so 1
we 1
did 1
So 1
we 1
always 1
do 1
I 1
m 1
glad 1
your 1
dreams 1
could 1
take 1
even 1
that 1
much 1
trouble 1
about 1
us 1
And 1
I 1
dreamt 1
that 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
s 1
mother 1
was 1
here 1
Why 1
she 1
was 1
here 1
Did 1
you 1
dream 1
any 1
more 1
Oh 1
lots 1
But 1
it 1
s 1
so 1
dim 1
now 1
Well 1
try 1
to 1
recollect 1
can 1
t 1
you 1
Somehow 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
wind 1
the 1
wind 1
blowed 1
the 1
the 1
Try 1
harder 1
Tom 1
The 1
wind 1
did 1
blow 1
something 1
Come 1
Tom 1
pressed 1
his 1
fingers 1
on 1
his 1
forehead 1
an 1
anxious 1
minute 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
it 1
now 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
it 1
now 1
It 1
blowed 1
the 1
candle 1
Mercy 1
on 1
us 1
Go 1
on 1
Tom 1
go 1
on 1
And 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
you 1
said 1
Why 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
that 1
door 1
Go 1
on 1
Tom 1
Just 1
let 1
me 1
study 1
a 1
moment 1
just 1
a 1
moment 1
Oh 1

said 1

believed 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
open 1
As 1
I 1
m 1
sitting 1
here 1
I 1
did 1
Didn 1
t 1
I 1
Mary 1
Go 1
on 1
And 1
then 1
and 1
then 1
well 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
certain 1
but 1
it 1
seems 1
like 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
made 1
Sid 1
go 1
and 1
and 1
Well 1
Well 1
What 1
did 1
I 1
make 1
him 1
do 1
Tom 1
What 1
did 1
I 1
make 1

You 1
made 1
him 1

Oh 1

made 1
him 1
shut 1
it 1
Well 1
for 1
the 1
land 1
s 1
sake 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
the 1
beat 1
of 1
that 1
in 1
all 1
my 1
days 1
Don 1
t 1
tell 1
me 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
anything 1

Sereny 1
Harper 1

know 1
of 1
this 1
before 1
I 1
m 1
an 1
hour 1
older 1
I 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
get 1
around 1
this 1
with 1
her 1
rubbage 1
bout 1
superstition 1
Go 1

Tom 1
Oh 1

Next 1

mischeevous 1
and 1
harum 1
scarum 1
and 1
not 1
any 1
more 1
responsible 1
than 1
than 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
colt 1
or 1
something 1
And 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
Well 1
goodness 1
gracious 1
Go 1
on 1
Tom 1
And 1
then 1
you 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
So 1
I 1
did 1
So 1
I 1
did 1
Not 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
neither 1
And 1
then 1
Then 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
cry 1
and 1
said 1
Joe 1
was 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
and 1
she 1
wished 1
she 1
hadn 1
t 1
whipped 1
him 1
for 1
taking 1
cream 1
when 1
she 1
d 1
throwed 1
it 1
out 1
her 1
own 1
self 1
Tom 1
The 1
sperrit 1
was 1
upon 1
you 1
You 1

a 1
prophesying 1
that 1
s 1
what 1

Land 1

Then 1
Sid 1
he 1

Sid 1
Yes 1

Sid 1
said 1
Mary 1
Shut 1
your 1
heads 1
and 1
let 1
Tom 1
go 1
on 1
What 1
did 1
he 1
say 1
Tom 1
He 1
said 1
I 1
think 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
hoped 1
I 1
was 1
better 1
off 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
gone 1
to 1
but 1
if 1
I 1
d 1

better 1
sometimes 1
There 1
d 1
you 1
hear 1
that 1
It 1
was 1
his 1
very 1
words 1
And 1
you 1
shut 1
him 1
up 1
sharp 1
I 1
lay 1
I 1
did 1
There 1
must 1
a 1
been 1
an 1
angel 1
there 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
angel 1
there 1
somewheres 1
And 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
told 1
about 1
Joe 1
scaring 1
her 1
with 1
a 1
firecracker 1
and 1
you 1
told 1
about 1
Peter 1
and 1
the 1
Pain 1
killer 1
Just 1
as 1
true 1
as 1
I 1
live 1
And 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
whole 1
lot 1
of 1
talk 1
bout 1
dragging 1
the 1
river 1
for 1
us 1
and 1
bout 1
having 1
the 1
funeral 1
Sunday 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
and 1
old 1
Miss 1
Harper 1
hugged 1
and 1
cried 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
It 1
happened 1
just 1
so 1
It 1
happened 1
just 1
so 1
as 1
sure 1
as 1

m 1
a 1
sitting 1
in 1
these 1
very 1
tracks 1
Tom 1
you 1
couldn 1

if 1
you 1
d 1
a 1
seen 1
it 1
And 1
then 1
what 1
Go 1
on 1
Tom 1
Then 1
I 1
thought 1
you 1
prayed 1
for 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
you 1
and 1
hear 1
every 1
word 1
you 1
said 1
And 1
you 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
sorry 1
that 1
I 1
took 1
and 1
wrote 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
sycamore 1
bark 1
We 1
ain 1
t 1
dead 1
we 1
are 1
only 1
off 1
being 1
pirates 1
and 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
by 1
the 1
candle 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
looked 1
so 1
good 1
laying 1
there 1
asleep 1
that 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
went 1
and 1
leaned 1
over 1
and 1
kissed 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
lips 1
Did 1
you 1
Tom 1
did 1
you 1
I 1
just 1
forgive 1
you 1
everything 1
for 1
that 1
And 1
she 1
seized 1
the 1
boy 1
in 1
a 1
crushing 1
embrace 1
that 1
made 1
him 1
feel 1
like 1
the 1
guiltiest 1
of 1
villains 1
It 1
was 1
very 1
kind 1
even 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
Sid 1
soliloquized 1
just 1
audibly 1
Shut 1
up 1
Sid 1
A 1
body 1
does 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
in 1
a 1
dream 1
as 1
he 1
d 1
do 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
awake 1
Here 1
s 1
a 1
big 1
Milum 1
apple 1
I 1
ve 1
been 1
saving 1
for 1
you 1
Tom 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
ever 1
found 1
again 1
now 1
go 1
long 1
to 1
school 1
I 1
m 1
thankful 1
to 1
the 1
good 1
God 1
and 1
Father 1
of 1
us 1
all 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
you 1
back 1
that 1
s 1
long 1
suffering 1
and 1
merciful 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
believe 1
on 1
Him 1
and 1
keep 1
His 1
word 1
though 1
goodness 1
knows 1
I 1
m 1
unworthy 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
if 1
only 1
the 1
worthy 1
ones 1
got 1
His 1
blessings 1
and 1
had 1
His 1
hand 1
to 1
help 1
them 1
over 1
the 1
rough 1
places 1
there 1
s 1
few 1
enough 1
would 1
smile 1
here 1
or 1
ever 1
enter 1
into 1
His 1
rest 1
when 1
the 1
long 1
night 1
comes 1
Go 1
long 1
Sid 1
Mary 1
Tom 1
take 1
yourselves 1
off 1
you 1
ve 1
hendered 1
me 1
long 1
enough 1
The 1
children 1
left 1
for 1
school 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
lady 1
to 1
call 1
on 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
and 1
vanquish 1
her 1
realism 1
with 1
Tom 1
s 1
marvellous 1
dream 1
Sid 1
had 1
better 1
judgment 1
than 1
to 1
utter 1
the 1
thought 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
as 1
he 1
left 1
the 1
house 1
It 1
was 1
this 1
Pretty 1
thin 1
as 1
long 1
a 1
dream 1
as 1
that 1
without 1
any 1
mistakes 1
in 1
it 1
What 1
a 1
hero 1
Tom 1
was 1
become 1
now 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
go 1
skipping 1
and 1
prancing 1
but 1
moved 1
with 1
a 1
dignified 1
swagger 1
as 1
became 1
a 1
pirate 1
who 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
public 1
eye 1
was 1
on 1
him 1
And 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
tried 1
not 1
to 1
seem 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
looks 1
or 1
hear 1
the 1
remarks 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
along 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
food 1
and 1
drink 1
to 1
him 1
Smaller 1
boys 1
than 1
himself 1
flocked 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
as 1
proud 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
tolerated 1
by 1
him 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
drummer 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
procession 1
or 1
the 1
elephant 1
leading 1
a 1
menagerie 1
into 1
town 1
Boys 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
size 1
pretended 1
not 1
to 1
know 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
away 1
at 1
all 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
consuming 1
with 1
envy 1
nevertheless 1
They 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
anything 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
swarthy 1
sun 1
tanned 1
skin 1
of 1
his 1
and 1
his 1
glittering 1
notoriety 1
and 1
Tom 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
parted 1
with 1
either 1
for 1
a 1
circus 1
At 1
school 1
the 1
children 1
made 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
him 1
and 1
of 1
Joe 1
and 1
delivered 1
such 1
eloquent 1
admiration 1
from 1
their 1
eyes 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
heroes 1
were 1
not 1
long 1
in 1
becoming 1
insufferably 1
stuck 1
up 1
They 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
their 1
adventures 1
to 1
hungry 1
listeners 1
but 1
they 1
only 1
began 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
thing 1
likely 1
to 1
have 1
an 1
end 1
with 1
imaginations 1
like 1
theirs 1
to 1
furnish 1
material 1
And 1
finally 1
when 1
they 1
got 1
out 1
their 1
pipes 1
and 1
went 1
serenely 1
puffing 1
around 1
the 1
very 1
summit 1
of 1
glory 1
was 1
reached 1
Tom 1
decided 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
independent 1
of 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
now 1
Glory 1
was 1
sufficient 1
He 1
would 1
live 1
for 1
glory 1
Now 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
distinguished 1
maybe 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
wanting 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
Well 1
let 1
her 1
she 1
should 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
as 1
indifferent 1
as 1
some 1
other 1
people 1
Presently 1
she 1
arrived 1
Tom 1
pretended 1
not 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
He 1
moved 1
away 1
and 1
joined 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
talk 1
Soon 1
he 1
observed 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
tripping 1
gayly 1
back 1
and 1
forth 1
with 1
flushed 1
face 1
and 1
dancing 1
eyes 1
pretending 1
to 1
be 1
busy 1
chasing 1
schoolmates 1
and 1
screaming 1
with 1
laughter 1
when 1
she 1
made 1
a 1
capture 1
but 1
he 1
noticed 1
that 1
she 1
always 1
made 1
her 1
captures 1
in 1
his 1
vicinity 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
seemed 1
to 1
cast 1
a 1
conscious 1
eye 1
in 1
his 1
direction 1
at 1
such 1
times 1
too 1
It 1
gratified 1
all 1
the 1
vicious 1
vanity 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
so 1
instead 1
of 1
winning 1
him 1
it 1
only 1
set 1
him 1
up 1
the 1
more 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
the 1
more 1
diligent 1
to 1
avoid 1
betraying 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
about 1
Presently 1
she 1
gave 1
over 1
skylarking 1
and 1
moved 1
irresolutely 1
about 1
sighing 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
and 1
glancing 1
furtively 1
and 1
wistfully 1
toward 1
Tom 1
Then 1
she 1
observed 1
that 1
now 1
Tom 1
was 1
talking 1
more 1
particularly 1
to 1
Amy 1
Lawrence 1
than 1
to 1
any 1
one 1
else 1
She 1
felt 1
a 1
sharp 1
pang 1
and 1
grew 1
disturbed 1
and 1
uneasy 1
at 1
once 1
She 1
tried 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
but 1
her 1
feet 1
were 1
treacherous 1
and 1
carried 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
group 1
instead 1
She 1
said 1
to 1
a 1
girl 1
almost 1
at 1
Tom 1
s 1
elbow 1
with 1
sham 1
vivacity 1
Why 1
Mary 1
Austin 1
you 1
bad 1
girl 1
why 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
Sunday 1

t 1

see 1
me 1
Why 1
no 1
Did 1

Where 1
did 1
you 1
sit 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
Miss 1
Peters 1
class 1
where 1
I 1
always 1
go 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
Did 1
you 1
Why 1
it 1
s 1
funny 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
you 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
about 1
the 1
picnic 1
Oh 1
that 1
s 1
jolly 1
Who 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
My 1
ma 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
one 1
Oh 1
goody 1
I 1
hope 1
she 1
ll 1
let 1
me 1
come 1
Well 1
she 1
will 1
The 1
picnic 1
s 1
for 1
me 1
She 1
ll 1
let 1
anybody 1
come 1
that 1
I 1
want 1
and 1
I 1
want 1
you 1
That 1
s 1
ever 1
so 1
nice 1
When 1
is 1
it 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Maybe 1
about 1
vacation 1
Oh 1
won 1
t 1
it 1
be 1
fun 1
You 1
going 1
to 1
have 1
all 1
the 1
girls 1
and 1
boys 1
Yes 1
every 1
one 1
that 1
s 1
friends 1
to 1
me 1
or 1
wants 1
to 1
be 1
and 1
she 1
glanced 1
ever 1
so 1
furtively 1
at 1
Tom 1
but 1
he 1
talked 1
right 1
along 1
to 1
Amy 1
Lawrence 1
about 1
the 1
terrible 1
storm 1
on 1
the 1
island 1
and 1
how 1
the 1
lightning 1
tore 1
the 1
great 1
sycamore 1
tree 1
all 1
to 1
flinders 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
standing 1
within 1
three 1
feet 1
of 1
it 1
Oh 1
may 1
I 1
come 1
said 1
Grace 1
Miller 1
Yes 1
And 1
me 1
said 1
Sally 1
Rogers 1
Yes 1
And 1
me 1
too 1
said 1
Susy 1
Harper 1
And 1
Joe 1
Yes 1
And 1
so 1
on 1
with 1
clapping 1
of 1
joyful 1
hands 1
till 1
all 1
the 1
group 1
had 1
begged 1
for 1
invitations 1
but 1
Tom 1
and 1
Amy 1
Then 1
Tom 1
turned 1
coolly 1
away 1
still 1
talking 1
and 1
took 1
Amy 1
with 1
him 1
Becky 1
s 1
lips 1
trembled 1
and 1
the 1
tears 1
came 1
to 1
her 1
eyes 1
she 1
hid 1
these 1
signs 1
with 1
a 1
forced 1
gayety 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
chattering 1
but 1
the 1
life 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
picnic 1
now 1
and 1
out 1
of 1
everything 1
else 1
she 1
got 1
away 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
and 1
hid 1
herself 1
and 1
had 1
what 1
her 1
sex 1
call 1
a 1
good 1
cry 1
Then 1
she 1
sat 1
moody 1
with 1
wounded 1
pride 1
till 1
the 1
bell 1
rang 1
She 1
roused 1
up 1
now 1
with 1
a 1
vindictive 1
cast 1
in 1
her 1
eye 1
and 1
gave 1
her 1
plaited 1
tails 1
a 1
shake 1
and 1
said 1
she 1
knew 1
what 1
she 1
d 1
do 1
At 1
recess 1
Tom 1
continued 1
his 1
flirtation 1
with 1
Amy 1
with 1
jubilant 1
self 1
satisfaction 1
And 1
he 1
kept 1
drifting 1
about 1
to 1
find 1
Becky 1
and 1
lacerate 1
her 1
with 1
the 1
performance 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
spied 1
her 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
sudden 1
falling 1
of 1
his 1
mercury 1
She 1
was 1
sitting 1
cosily 1
on 1
a 1
little 1
bench 1
behind 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
looking 1
at 1
a 1
picture 1
book 1
with 1
Alfred 1
Temple 1
and 1
so 1
absorbed 1
were 1
they 1
and 1
their 1
heads 1
so 1
close 1
together 1
over 1
the 1
book 1
that 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
conscious 1
of 1
anything 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
besides 1
Jealousy 1
ran 1
red 1
hot 1
through 1
Tom 1
s 1
veins 1
He 1
began 1
to 1
hate 1
himself 1
for 1
throwing 1
away 1
the 1
chance 1
Becky 1
had 1
offered 1
for 1
a 1
reconciliation 1
He 1
called 1
himself 1
a 1
fool 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
hard 1
names 1
he 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
He 1
wanted 1
to 1
cry 1
with 1
vexation 1
Amy 1
chatted 1
happily 1
along 1
as 1
they 1
walked 1
for 1
her 1
heart 1
was 1
singing 1
but 1
Tom 1
s 1
tongue 1
had 1
lost 1
its 1
function 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
hear 1
what 1
Amy 1
was 1
saying 1
and 1
whenever 1
she 1
paused 1
expectantly 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
stammer 1
an 1
awkward 1
assent 1
which 1
was 1
as 1
often 1
misplaced 1
as 1
otherwise 1
He 1
kept 1
drifting 1
to 1
the 1
rear 1
of 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
to 1
sear 1
his 1
eyeballs 1
with 1
the 1
hateful 1
spectacle 1
there 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
it 1
And 1
it 1
maddened 1
him 1
to 1
see 1
as 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
never 1
once 1
suspected 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
of 1
the 1
living 1
But 1
she 1
did 1
see 1
nevertheless 1
and 1
she 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
winning 1
her 1
fight 1
too 1
and 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
suffer 1
as 1
she 1
had 1
suffered 1
Amy 1
s 1
happy 1
prattle 1
became 1
intolerable 1
Tom 1
hinted 1
at 1
things 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
attend 1
to 1
things 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
time 1
was 1
fleeting 1
But 1
in 1
vain 1
the 1
girl 1
chirped 1
on 1
Tom 1
thought 1
Oh 1
hang 1
her 1
ain 1
t 1
I 1
ever 1
going 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
her 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
attending 1
to 1
those 1
things 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
artlessly 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
around 1
when 1
school 1
let 1
out 1
And 1
he 1
hastened 1
away 1
hating 1
her 1
for 1
it 1
Any 1
other 1
boy 1
Tom 1
thought 1
grating 1
his 1
teeth 1
Any 1
boy 1
in 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
but 1
that 1
Saint 1
Louis 1
smarty 1
that 1
thinks 1
he 1
dresses 1
so 1
fine 1
and 1
is 1
aristocracy 1
Oh 1
all 1
right 1
I 1
licked 1
you 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
you 1
ever 1
saw 1
this 1
town 1
mister 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
lick 1
you 1
again 1
You 1
just 1
wait 1
till 1
I 1
catch 1
you 1
out 1
I 1
ll 1
just 1
take 1
and 1
And 1
he 1
went 1
through 1
the 1
motions 1
of 1
thrashing 1
an 1
imaginary 1
boy 1
pummelling 1
the 1
air 1
and 1
kicking 1
and 1
gouging 1
Oh 1
you 1
do 1
do 1
you 1
You 1
holler 1
nough 1
do 1
you 1
Now 1
then 1
let 1
that 1
learn 1
you 1
And 1
so 1
the 1
imaginary 1
flogging 1
was 1
finished 1
to 1
his 1
satisfaction 1
Tom 1
fled 1
home 1
at 1
noon 1
His 1
conscience 1
could 1
not 1
endure 1
any 1
more 1
of 1
Amy 1
s 1
grateful 1
happiness 1
and 1
his 1
jealousy 1
could 1
bear 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
distress 1
Becky 1
resumed 1
her 1
picture 1
inspections 1
with 1
Alfred 1
but 1
as 1
the 1
minutes 1
dragged 1
along 1
and 1
no 1
Tom 1
came 1
to 1
suffer 1
her 1
triumph 1
began 1
to 1
cloud 1
and 1
she 1
lost 1
interest 1
gravity 1
and 1
absentmindedness 1
followed 1
and 1
then 1
melancholy 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
she 1
pricked 1
up 1
her 1
ear 1
at 1
a 1
footstep 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
false 1
hope 1
no 1
Tom 1
came 1
At 1
last 1
she 1
grew 1
entirely 1
miserable 1
and 1
wished 1
she 1
hadn 1
t 1
carried 1
it 1
so 1
far 1
When 1
poor 1
Alfred 1
seeing 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
losing 1
her 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
kept 1
exclaiming 1
Oh 1
here 1
s 1
a 1
jolly 1
one 1
look 1
at 1
this 1
she 1
lost 1
patience 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
said 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
bother 1
me 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
and 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
walked 1
away 1
Alfred 1
dropped 1
alongside 1
and 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
comfort 1
her 1
but 1
she 1
said 1
Go 1
away 1
and 1
leave 1
me 1
alone 1
can 1
t 1
you 1
I 1
hate 1
you 1
So 1
the 1
boy 1
halted 1
wondering 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
look 1
at 1
pictures 1
all 1
through 1
the 1
nooning 1
and 1
she 1
walked 1
on 1
crying 1
Then 1
Alfred 1
went 1
musing 1
into 1
the 1
deserted 1
schoolhouse 1
He 1
was 1
humiliated 1
and 1
angry 1
He 1
easily 1
guessed 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
truth 1
the 1
girl 1
had 1
simply 1
made 1
a 1
convenience 1
of 1
him 1
to 1
vent 1
her 1
spite 1
upon 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
He 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
hating 1
Tom 1
the 1
less 1
when 1
this 1
thought 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
He 1
wished 1
there 1
was 1
some 1
way 1
to 1
get 1
that 1
boy 1
into 1
trouble 1
without 1
much 1
risk 1
to 1
himself 1
Tom 1
s 1
spelling 1
book 1
fell 1
under 1
his 1
eye 1
Here 1
was 1
his 1
opportunity 1
He 1
gratefully 1
opened 1
to 1
the 1
lesson 1
for 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
poured 1
ink 1
upon 1
the 1
page 1
Becky 1
glancing 1
in 1
at 1
a 1
window 1
behind 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
saw 1
the 1
act 1
and 1
moved 1
on 1
without 1
discovering 1
herself 1
She 1
started 1
homeward 1
now 1
intending 1
to 1
find 1
Tom 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
Tom 1
would 1
be 1
thankful 1
and 1
their 1
troubles 1
would 1
be 1
healed 1
Before 1
she 1
was 1
half 1
way 1
home 1
however 1
she 1
had 1
changed 1
her 1
mind 1
The 1
thought 1
of 1
Tom 1
s 1
treatment 1
of 1
her 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
talking 1
about 1
her 1
picnic 1
came 1
scorching 1
back 1
and 1
filled 1
her 1
with 1
shame 1
She 1
resolved 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
get 1
whipped 1
on 1
the 1
damaged 1
spelling 1
book 1
s 1
account 1
and 1
to 1
hate 1
him 1
forever 1
into 1
the 1
bargain 1
CHAPTER 1
XIX 1
TOM 1
arrived 1
at 1
home 1
in 1
a 1
dreary 1
mood 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
his 1
aunt 1
said 1
to 1
him 1
showed 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
his 1
sorrows 1
to 1
an 1
unpromising 1
market 1
Tom 1
I 1
ve 1
a 1
notion 1
to 1
skin 1
you 1
alive 1
Auntie 1
what 1
have 1
I 1
done 1
Well 1
you 1
ve 1
done 1
enough 1
Here 1
I 1
go 1
over 1
to 1
Sereny 1
Harper 1
like 1
an 1
old 1
softy 1
expecting 1
I 1
m 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
believe 1
all 1
that 1
rubbage 1
about 1
that 1
dream 1
when 1
lo 1
and 1
behold 1
you 1
she 1
d 1
found 1
out 1
from 1
Joe 1
that 1
you 1
was 1
over 1
here 1
and 1
heard 1
all 1
the 1
talk 1
we 1
had 1
that 1
night 1
Tom 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
is 1
to 1
become 1
of 1
a 1
boy 1
that 1
will 1
act 1
like 1
that 1
It 1
makes 1
me 1
feel 1
so 1
bad 1
to 1
think 1
you 1
could 1
let 1
me 1
go 1
to 1
Sereny 1
Harper 1
and 1
make 1
such 1
a 1
fool 1
of 1
myself 1
and 1
never 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
This 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
aspect 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
His 1
smartness 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
had 1
seemed 1
to 1
Tom 1
a 1
good 1
joke 1
before 1
and 1
very 1
ingenious 1
It 1
merely 1
looked 1
mean 1
and 1
shabby 1
now 1
He 1
hung 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
to 1
say 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
Auntie 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
done 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
Oh 1
child 1
you 1
never 1
think 1
You 1
never 1
think 1
of 1
anything 1
but 1
your 1
own 1
selfishness 1
You 1
could 1
think 1
to 1
come 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
over 1
here 1
from 1
Jackson 1
s 1
Island 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
to 1
laugh 1
at 1
our 1
troubles 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
think 1
to 1
fool 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
lie 1
about 1
a 1
dream 1
but 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
ever 1
think 1
to 1
pity 1
us 1
and 1
save 1
us 1
from 1
sorrow 1
Auntie 1
I 1
know 1
now 1
it 1
was 1
mean 1
but 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
mean 1
to 1
be 1
mean 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
honest 1
And 1
besides 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
come 1
over 1
here 1
to 1
laugh 1
at 1
you 1
that 1
night 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
for 1
then 1
It 1
was 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
uneasy 1
about 1
us 1
because 1
we 1
hadn 1
t 1
got 1
drownded 1
Tom 1
Tom 1
I 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
thankfullest 1
soul 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
believe 1
you 1
ever 1
had 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
thought 1
as 1
that 1
but 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
never 1
did 1
and 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
Tom 1
Indeed 1
and 1
deed 1
I 1
did 1
auntie 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
may 1
never 1
stir 1
if 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
Oh 1
Tom 1
don 1
t 1
lie 1
don 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
It 1
only 1
makes 1
things 1
a 1
hundred 1
times 1
worse 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
lie 1
auntie 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
truth 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
keep 1
you 1
from 1
grieving 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
that 1
made 1
me 1
come 1
I 1
d 1
give 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
cover 1
up 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
sins 1
Tom 1
I 1
d 1
most 1
be 1
glad 1
you 1
d 1
run 1
off 1
and 1
acted 1
so 1
bad 1
But 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
reasonable 1
because 1
why 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
child 1
Why 1
you 1
see 1
when 1
you 1
got 1
to 1
talking 1
about 1
the 1
funeral 1
I 1
just 1
got 1
all 1
full 1
of 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
our 1
coming 1
and 1
hiding 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
somehow 1
bear 1
to 1
spoil 1
it 1
So 1
I 1
just 1
put 1
the 1
bark 1
back 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
and 1
kept 1
mum 1
What 1
bark 1
The 1
bark 1
I 1
had 1
wrote 1
on 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
we 1
d 1
gone 1
pirating 1
I 1
wish 1
now 1
you 1
d 1
waked 1
up 1
when 1
I 1
kissed 1
you 1
I 1
do 1
honest 1
The 1
hard 1
lines 1
in 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
face 1
relaxed 1
and 1
a 1
sudden 1
tenderness 1
dawned 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
Did 1
you 1
kiss 1
me 1
Tom 1
Why 1
yes 1
I 1
did 1
Are 1
you 1
sure 1
you 1
did 1
Tom 1
Why 1
yes 1
I 1
did 1
auntie 1
certain 1
sure 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
kiss 1
me 1
for 1
Tom 1
Because 1
I 1
loved 1
you 1
so 1
and 1
you 1
laid 1
there 1
moaning 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
sorry 1
The 1
words 1
sounded 1
like 1
truth 1
The 1
old 1
lady 1
could 1
not 1
hide 1
a 1
tremor 1
in 1
her 1
voice 1
when 1
she 1
said 1
Kiss 1
me 1
again 1
Tom 1
and 1
be 1
off 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
school 1
now 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
bother 1
me 1
any 1
more 1
The 1
moment 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
she 1
ran 1
to 1
a 1
closet 1
and 1
got 1
out 1
the 1
ruin 1
of 1
a 1
jacket 1
which 1
Tom 1
had 1
gone 1
pirating 1
in 1
Then 1
she 1
stopped 1
with 1
it 1
in 1
her 1
hand 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
No 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
dare 1
Poor 1
boy 1
I 1
reckon 1
he 1
s 1
lied 1
about 1
it 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
blessed 1
blessed 1
lie 1
there 1
s 1
such 1
a 1
comfort 1
come 1
from 1
it 1
I 1
hope 1
the 1
Lord 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
Lord 1
will 1
forgive 1
him 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
such 1
good 1
heartedness 1
in 1
him 1
to 1
tell 1
it 1
But 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
lie 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
look 1
She 1
put 1
the 1
jacket 1
away 1
and 1
stood 1
by 1
musing 1
a 1
minute 1
Twice 1
she 1
put 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
garment 1
again 1
and 1
twice 1
she 1
refrained 1
Once 1
more 1
she 1
ventured 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
she 1
fortified 1
herself 1
with 1
the 1
thought 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
lie 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
good 1
lie 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
let 1
it 1
grieve 1
me 1
So 1
she 1
sought 1
the 1
jacket 1
pocket 1
A 1
moment 1
later 1
she 1
was 1
reading 1
Tom 1
s 1
piece 1
of 1
bark 1
through 1
flowing 1
tears 1
and 1
saying 1
I 1
could 1
forgive 1
the 1
boy 1
now 1
if 1
he 1
d 1
committed 1
a 1
million 1
sins 1
CHAPTER 1
XX 1
THERE 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
manner 1
when 1
she 1
kissed 1
Tom 1
that 1
swept 1
away 1
his 1
low 1
spirits 1
and 1
made 1
him 1
lighthearted 1
and 1
happy 1
again 1
He 1
started 1
to 1
school 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
luck 1
of 1
coming 1
upon 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
Meadow 1
Lane 1
His 1
mood 1
always 1
determined 1
his 1
manner 1
Without 1
a 1
moment 1
s 1
hesitation 1
he 1
ran 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
said 1
I 1
acted 1
mighty 1
mean 1
today 1
Becky 1
and 1
I 1
m 1
so 1
sorry 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
ever 1
ever 1
do 1
that 1
way 1
again 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
ever 1
I 1
live 1
please 1
make 1
up 1
won 1
t 1
you 1
The 1
girl 1
stopped 1
and 1
looked 1
him 1
scornfully 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
I 1
ll 1
thank 1
you 1
to 1
keep 1
yourself 1
to 1
yourself 1
Mr 1
Thomas 1
Sawyer 1
I 1
ll 1
never 1
speak 1
to 1
you 1
again 1
She 1
tossed 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
passed 1
on 1
Tom 1
was 1
so 1
stunned 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
presence 1
of 1
mind 1
enough 1
to 1
say 1
Who 1
cares 1
Miss 1
Smarty 1
until 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
to 1
say 1
it 1
had 1
gone 1
by 1
So 1
he 1
said 1
nothing 1
But 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
fine 1
rage 1
nevertheless 1
He 1
moped 1
into 1
the 1
schoolyard 1
wishing 1
she 1
were 1
a 1
boy 1
and 1
imagining 1
how 1
he 1
would 1
trounce 1
her 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
He 1
presently 1
encountered 1
her 1
and 1
delivered 1
a 1
stinging 1
remark 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
She 1
hurled 1
one 1
in 1
return 1
and 1
the 1
angry 1
breach 1
was 1
complete 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
Becky 1
in 1
her 1
hot 1
resentment 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
hardly 1
wait 1
for 1
school 1
to 1
take 1
in 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
impatient 1
to 1
see 1
Tom 1
flogged 1
for 1
the 1
injured 1
spelling 1
book 1
If 1
she 1
had 1
had 1
any 1
lingering 1
notion 1
of 1
exposing 1
Alfred 1
Temple 1
Tom 1
s 1
offensive 1
fling 1
had 1
driven 1
it 1
entirely 1
away 1
Poor 1
girl 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
fast 1
she 1
was 1
nearing 1
trouble 1
herself 1
The 1
master 1
Mr 1
Dobbins 1
had 1
reached 1
middle 1
age 1
with 1
an 1
unsatisfied 1
ambition 1
The 1
darling 1
of 1
his 1
desires 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
doctor 1
but 1
poverty 1
had 1
decreed 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
nothing 1
higher 1
than 1
a 1
village 1
schoolmaster 1
Every 1
day 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
mysterious 1
book 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
absorbed 1
himself 1
in 1
it 1
at 1
times 1
when 1
no 1
classes 1
were 1
reciting 1
He 1
kept 1
that 1
book 1
under 1
lock 1
and 1
key 1
There 1
was 1
not 1
an 1
urchin 1
in 1
school 1
but 1
was 1
perishing 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
the 1
chance 1
never 1
came 1
Every 1
boy 1
and 1
girl 1
had 1
a 1
theory 1
about 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
that 1
book 1
but 1
no 1
two 1
theories 1
were 1
alike 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
getting 1
at 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
Now 1
as 1
Becky 1
was 1
passing 1
by 1
the 1
desk 1
which 1
stood 1
near 1
the 1
door 1
she 1
noticed 1
that 1
the 1
key 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
precious 1
moment 1
She 1
glanced 1
around 1
found 1
herself 1
alone 1
and 1
the 1
next 1
instant 1
she 1
had 1
the 1
book 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
The 1
titlepage 1
Professor 1
Somebody 1
s 1
Anatomy 1
carried 1
no 1
information 1
to 1
her 1
mind 1
so 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
the 1
leaves 1
She 1
came 1
at 1
once 1
upon 1
a 1
handsomely 1
engraved 1
and 1
colored 1
frontispiece 1
a 1
human 1
figure 1
stark 1
naked 1
At 1
that 1
moment 1
a 1
shadow 1
fell 1
on 1
the 1
page 1
and 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
stepped 1
in 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
caught 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
Becky 1
snatched 1
at 1
the 1
book 1
to 1
close 1
it 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
hard 1
luck 1
to 1
tear 1
the 1
pictured 1
page 1
half 1
down 1
the 1
middle 1
She 1
thrust 1
the 1
volume 1
into 1
the 1
desk 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
and 1
burst 1
out 1
crying 1
with 1
shame 1
and 1
vexation 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
you 1
are 1
just 1
as 1
mean 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
be 1
to 1
sneak 1
up 1
on 1
a 1
person 1
and 1
look 1
at 1
what 1
they 1
re 1
looking 1
at 1
How 1
could 1
I 1
know 1
you 1
was 1
looking 1
at 1
anything 1
You 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
yourself 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
re 1
going 1
to 1
tell 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
oh 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
I 1
ll 1
be 1
whipped 1
and 1
I 1
never 1
was 1
whipped 1
in 1
school 1
Then 1
she 1
stamped 1
her 1
little 1
foot 1
and 1
said 1
Be 1
so 1
mean 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
I 1
know 1
something 1
that 1
s 1
going 1
to 1
happen 1
You 1
just 1
wait 1
and 1
you 1
ll 1
see 1
Hateful 1
hateful 1
hateful 1
and 1
she 1
flung 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
a 1
new 1
explosion 1
of 1
crying 1
Tom 1
stood 1
still 1
rather 1
flustered 1
by 1
this 1
onslaught 1
Presently 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
What 1
a 1
curious 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
fool 1
a 1
girl 1
is 1
Never 1
been 1
licked 1
in 1
school 1
Shucks 1
What 1
s 1
a 1
licking 1
That 1
s 1
just 1
like 1
a 1
girl 1
they 1
re 1
so 1
thin 1
skinned 1
and 1
chicken 1
hearted 1
Well 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
ain 1
t 1
going 1
to 1
tell 1
old 1
Dobbins 1
on 1
this 1
little 1
fool 1
because 1
there 1
s 1
other 1
ways 1
of 1
getting 1
even 1
on 1
her 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
so 1
mean 1
but 1
what 1
of 1
it 1
Old 1
Dobbins 1
will 1
ask 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
tore 1
his 1
book 1
Nobody 1
ll 1
answer 1
Then 1
he 1
ll 1
do 1
just 1
the 1
way 1
he 1
always 1
does 1
ask 1
first 1
one 1
and 1
then 1
t 1
other 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
comes 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
girl 1
he 1
ll 1
know 1
it 1
without 1
any 1
telling 1
Girls 1
faces 1
always 1
tell 1
on 1
them 1
They 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
any 1
backbone 1
She 1
ll 1
get 1
licked 1
Well 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
tight 1
place 1
for 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
because 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
any 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Tom 1
conned 1
the 1
thing 1
a 1
moment 1
longer 1
and 1
then 1
added 1
All 1
right 1
though 1
she 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
in 1
just 1
such 1
a 1
fix 1
let 1
her 1
sweat 1
it 1
out 1
Tom 1
joined 1
the 1
mob 1
of 1
skylarking 1
scholars 1
outside 1
In 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
the 1
master 1
arrived 1
and 1
school 1
took 1
in 1
Tom 1
did 1
not 1
feel 1
a 1
strong 1
interest 1
in 1
his 1
studies 1
Every 1
time 1
he 1
stole 1
a 1
glance 1
at 1
the 1
girls 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
Becky 1
s 1
face 1
troubled 1
him 1
Considering 1
all 1
things 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
pity 1
her 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
to 1
help 1
it 1
He 1
could 1
get 1
up 1
no 1
exultation 1
that 1
was 1
really 1
worthy 1
the 1
name 1
Presently 1
the 1
spelling 1
book 1
discovery 1
was 1
made 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
mind 1
was 1
entirely 1
full 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
matters 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
after 1
that 1
Becky 1
roused 1
up 1
from 1
her 1
lethargy 1
of 1
distress 1
and 1
showed 1
good 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
proceedings 1
She 1
did 1
not 1
expect 1
that 1
Tom 1
could 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
trouble 1
by 1
denying 1
that 1
he 1
spilt 1
the 1
ink 1
on 1
the 1
book 1
himself 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
right 1
The 1
denial 1
only 1
seemed 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
thing 1
worse 1
for 1
Tom 1
Becky 1
supposed 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
glad 1
of 1
that 1
and 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
believe 1
she 1
was 1
glad 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
she 1
found 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
certain 1
When 1
the 1
worst 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
worst 1
she 1
had 1
an 1
impulse 1
to 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
tell 1
on 1
Alfred 1
Temple 1
but 1
she 1
made 1
an 1
effort 1
and 1
forced 1
herself 1
to 1
keep 1
still 1
because 1
said 1
she 1
to 1
herself 1
he 1
ll 1
tell 1
about 1
me 1
tearing 1
the 1
picture 1
sure 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
not 1
to 1
save 1
his 1
life 1
Tom 1
took 1
his 1
whipping 1
and 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
not 1
at 1
all 1
broken 1
hearted 1
for 1
he 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
unknowingly 1
upset 1
the 1
ink 1
on 1
the 1
spelling 1
book 1
himself 1
in 1
some 1
skylarking 1
bout 1
he 1
had 1
denied 1
it 1
for 1
form 1
s 1
sake 1
and 1
because 1
it 1
was 1
custom 1
and 1
had 1
stuck 1
to 1
the 1
denial 1
from 1
principle 1
A 1
whole 1
hour 1
drifted 1
by 1
the 1
master 1
sat 1
nodding 1
in 1
his 1
throne 1
the 1
air 1
was 1
drowsy 1
with 1
the 1
hum 1
of 1
study 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Mr 1
Dobbins 1
straightened 1
himself 1
up 1
yawned 1
then 1
unlocked 1
his 1
desk 1
and 1
reached 1
for 1
his 1
book 1
but 1
seemed 1
undecided 1
whether 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
out 1
or 1
leave 1
it 1
Most 1
of 1
the 1
pupils 1
glanced 1
up 1
languidly 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
two 1
among 1
them 1
that 1
watched 1
his 1
movements 1
with 1
intent 1
eyes 1
Mr 1
Dobbins 1
fingered 1
his 1
book 1
absently 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
then 1
took 1
it 1
out 1
and 1
settled 1
himself 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
to 1
read 1
Tom 1
shot 1
a 1
glance 1
at 1
Becky 1
He 1
had 1
seen 1
a 1
hunted 1
and 1
helpless 1
rabbit 1
look 1
as 1
she 1
did 1
with 1
a 1
gun 1
levelled 1
at 1
its 1
head 1
Instantly 1
he 1
forgot 1
his 1
quarrel 1
with 1
her 1
Quick 1
something 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
done 1
in 1
a 1
flash 1
too 1
But 1
the 1
very 1
imminence 1
of 1
the 1
emergency 1
paralyzed 1
his 1
invention 1
Good 1
he 1
had 1
an 1
inspiration 1
He 1
would 1
run 1
and 1
snatch 1
the 1
book 1
spring 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
fly 1
But 1
his 1
resolution 1
shook 1
for 1
one 1
little 1
instant 1
and 1
the 1
chance 1
was 1
lost 1
the 1
master 1
opened 1
the 1
volume 1
If 1
Tom 1
only 1
had 1
the 1
wasted 1
opportunity 1
back 1
again 1
Too 1
late 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
help 1
for 1
Becky 1
now 1
he 1
said 1
The 1
next 1
moment 1
the 1
master 1
faced 1
the 1
school 1
Every 1
eye 1
sank 1
under 1
his 1
gaze 1
There 1
was 1
that 1
in 1
it 1
which 1
smote 1
even 1
the 1
innocent 1
with 1
fear 1
There 1
was 1
silence 1
while 1
one 1
might 1
count 1
ten 1
the 1
master 1
was 1
gathering 1
his 1
wrath 1
Then 1
he 1
spoke 1
Who 1
tore 1
this 1
book 1
There 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
sound 1
One 1
could 1
have 1
heard 1
a 1
pin 1
drop 1
The 1
stillness 1
continued 1
the 1
master 1
searched 1
face 1
after 1
face 1
for 1
signs 1
of 1
guilt 1
Benjamin 1
Rogers 1
did 1
you 1
tear 1
this 1
book 1
A 1
denial 1
Another 1
pause 1
Joseph 1
Harper 1
did 1
you 1
Another 1
denial 1
Tom 1
s 1
uneasiness 1
grew 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
intense 1
under 1
the 1
slow 1
torture 1
of 1
these 1
proceedings 1
The 1
master 1
scanned 1
the 1
ranks 1
of 1
boys 1
considered 1
a 1
while 1
then 1
turned 1
to 1
the 1
girls 1
Amy 1
Lawrence 1
A 1
shake 1
of 1
the 1
head 1
Gracie 1
Miller 1
The 1
same 1
sign 1
Susan 1
Harper 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
this 1
Another 1
negative 1
The 1
next 1
girl 1
was 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
Tom 1
was 1
trembling 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
with 1
excitement 1
and 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
hopelessness 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
Rebecca 1
Thatcher 1
Tom 1
glanced 1
at 1
her 1
face 1
it 1
was 1
white 1
with 1
terror 1
did 1
you 1
tear 1
no 1
look 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
her 1
hands 1
rose 1
in 1
appeal 1
did 1
you 1
tear 1
this 1
book 1
A 1
thought 1
shot 1
like 1
lightning 1
through 1
Tom 1
s 1
brain 1
He 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
shouted 1
I 1
done 1
it 1
The 1
school 1
stared 1
in 1
perplexity 1
at 1
this 1
incredible 1
folly 1
Tom 1
stood 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
gather 1
his 1
dismembered 1
faculties 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
stepped 1
forward 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
his 1
punishment 1
the 1
surprise 1
the 1
gratitude 1
the 1
adoration 1
that 1
shone 1
upon 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
poor 1
Becky 1
s 1
eyes 1
seemed 1
pay 1
enough 1
for 1
a 1
hundred 1
floggings 1
Inspired 1
by 1
the 1
splendor 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
act 1
he 1
took 1
without 1
an 1
outcry 1
the 1
most 1
merciless 1
flaying 1
that 1
even 1
Mr 1
Dobbins 1
had 1
ever 1
administered 1
and 1
also 1
received 1
with 1
indifference 1
the 1
added 1
cruelty 1
of 1
a 1
command 1
to 1
remain 1
two 1
hours 1
after 1
school 1
should 1
be 1
dismissed 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
who 1
would 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
outside 1
till 1
his 1
captivity 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
not 1
count 1
the 1
tedious 1
time 1
as 1
loss 1
either 1
Tom 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
that 1
night 1
planning 1
vengeance 1
against 1
Alfred 1
Temple 1
for 1
with 1
shame 1
and 1
repentance 1
Becky 1
had 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
not 1
forgetting 1
her 1
own 1
treachery 1
but 1
even 1
the 1
longing 1
for 1
vengeance 1
had 1
to 1
give 1
way 1
soon 1
to 1
pleasanter 1
musings 1
and 1
he 1
fell 1
asleep 1
at 1
last 1
with 1
Becky 1
s 1
latest 1
words 1
lingering 1
dreamily 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
Tom 1
how 1
could 1
you 1
be 1
so 1
noble 1
CHAPTER 1
XXI 1
VACATION 1
was 1
approaching 1
The 1
schoolmaster 1
always 1
severe 1
grew 1
severer 1
and 1
more 1
exacting 1
than 1
ever 1
for 1
he 1
wanted 1
the 1
school 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
good 1
showing 1
on 1
Examination 1
day 1
His 1
rod 1
and 1
his 1
ferule 1
were 1
seldom 1
idle 1
now 1
at 1
least 1
among 1
the 1
smaller 1
pupils 1
Only 1
the 1
biggest 1
boys 1
and 1
young 1
ladies 1
of 1
eighteen 1
and 1
twenty 1
escaped 1
lashing 1
Mr 1
Dobbins 1
lashings 1
were 1
very 1
vigorous 1
ones 1
too 1
for 1
although 1
he 1
carried 1
under 1
his 1
wig 1
a 1
perfectly 1
bald 1
and 1
shiny 1
head 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
reached 1
middle 1
age 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
feebleness 1
in 1
his 1
muscle 1
As 1
the 1
great 1
day 1
approached 1
all 1
the 1
tyranny 1
that 1
was 1
in 1
him 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
surface 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
vindictive 1
pleasure 1
in 1
punishing 1
the 1
least 1
shortcomings 1
The 1
consequence 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
smaller 1
boys 1
spent 1
their 1
days 1
in 1
terror 1
and 1
suffering 1
and 1
their 1
nights 1
in 1
plotting 1
revenge 1
They 1
threw 1
away 1
no 1
opportunity 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
master 1
a 1
mischief 1
But 1
he 1
kept 1
ahead 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
The 1
retribution 1
that 1
followed 1
every 1
vengeful 1
success 1
was 1
so 1
sweeping 1
and 1
majestic 1
that 1
the 1
boys 1
always 1
retired 1
from 1
the 1
field 1
badly 1
worsted 1
At 1
last 1
they 1
conspired 1
together 1
and 1
hit 1
upon 1
a 1
plan 1
that 1
promised 1
a 1
dazzling 1
victory 1
They 1
swore 1
in 1
the 1
signpainter 1
s 1
boy 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
scheme 1
and 1
asked 1
his 1
help 1
He 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
reasons 1
for 1
being 1
delighted 1
for 1
the 1
master 1
boarded 1
in 1
his 1
father 1
s 1
family 1
and 1
had 1
given 1
the 1
boy 1
ample 1
cause 1
to 1
hate 1
him 1
The 1
master 1
s 1
wife 1
would 1
go 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
the 1
country 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
and 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
nothing 1
to 1
interfere 1
with 1
the 1
plan 1
the 1
master 1
always 1
prepared 1
himself 1
for 1
great 1
occasions 1
by 1
getting 1
pretty 1
well 1
fuddled 1
and 1
the 1
signpainter 1
s 1
boy 1
said 1
that 1
when 1
the 1
dominie 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
proper 1
condition 1
on 1
Examination 1
Evening 1
he 1
would 1
manage 1
the 1
thing 1
while 1
he 1
napped 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
him 1
awakened 1
at 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
and 1
hurried 1
away 1
to 1
school 1
In 1
the 1
fulness 1
of 1
time 1
the 1
interesting 1
occasion 1
arrived 1
At 1
eight 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
the 1
schoolhouse 1
was 1
brilliantly 1
lighted 1
and 1
adorned 1
with 1
wreaths 1
and 1
festoons 1
of 1
foliage 1
and 1
flowers 1
The 1
master 1
sat 1
throned 1
in 1
his 1
great 1
chair 1
upon 1
a 1
raised 1
platform 1
with 1
his 1
blackboard 1
behind 1
him 1
He 1
was 1
looking 1
tolerably 1
mellow 1
Three 1
rows 1
of 1
benches 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
and 1
six 1
rows 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
were 1
occupied 1
by 1
the 1
dignitaries 1
of 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
parents 1
of 1
the 1
pupils 1
To 1
his 1
left 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
rows 1
of 1
citizens 1
was 1
a 1
spacious 1
temporary 1
platform 1
upon 1
which 1
were 1
seated 1
the 1
scholars 1
who 1
were 1
to 1
take 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
exercises 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
rows 1
of 1
small 1
boys 1
washed 1
and 1
dressed 1
to 1
an 1
intolerable 1
state 1
of 1
discomfort 1
rows 1
of 1
gawky 1
big 1
boys 1
snowbanks 1
of 1
girls 1
and 1
young 1
ladies 1
clad 1
in 1
lawn 1
and 1
muslin 1
and 1
conspicuously 1
conscious 1
of 1
their 1
bare 1
arms 1
their 1
grandmothers 1
ancient 1
trinkets 1
their 1
bits 1
of 1
pink 1
and 1
blue 1
ribbon 1
and 1
the 1
flowers 1
in 1
their 1
hair 1
All 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
non 1
participating 1
scholars 1
The 1
exercises 1
began 1
A 1
very 1
little 1
boy 1
stood 1
up 1
and 1
sheepishly 1
recited 1
You 1
d 1
scarce 1
expect 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
age 1
to 1
speak 1
in 1
public 1
on 1
the 1
stage 1
etc 1
accompanying 1
himself 1
with 1
the 1
painfully 1
exact 1
and 1
spasmodic 1
gestures 1
which 1
a 1
machine 1
might 1
have 1
used 1
supposing 1
the 1
machine 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
trifle 1
out 1
of 1
order 1
But 1
he 1
got 1
through 1
safely 1
though 1
cruelly 1
scared 1
and 1
got 1
a 1
fine 1
round 1
of 1
applause 1
when 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
manufactured 1
bow 1
and 1
retired 1
A 1
little 1
shamefaced 1
girl 1
lisped 1
Mary 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
lamb 1
etc 1
performed 1
a 1
compassion 1
inspiring 1
curtsy 1
got 1
her 1
meed 1
of 1
applause 1
and 1
sat 1
down 1
flushed 1
and 1
happy 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
stepped 1
forward 1
with 1
conceited 1
confidence 1
and 1
soared 1
into 1
the 1
unquenchable 1
and 1
indestructible 1
Give 1
me 1
liberty 1
or 1
give 1
me 1
death 1
speech 1
with 1
fine 1
fury 1
and 1
frantic 1
gesticulation 1
and 1
broke 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
A 1
ghastly 1
stage 1
fright 1
seized 1
him 1
his 1
legs 1
quaked 1
under 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
like 1
to 1
choke 1
True 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
manifest 1
sympathy 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
house 1
s 1
silence 1
too 1
which 1
was 1
even 1
worse 1
than 1
its 1
sympathy 1
The 1
master 1
frowned 1
and 1
this 1
completed 1
the 1
disaster 1
Tom 1
struggled 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
retired 1
utterly 1
defeated 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
weak 1
attempt 1
at 1
applause 1
but 1
it 1
died 1
early 1
The 1
Boy 1
Stood 1
on 1
the 1
Burning 1
Deck 1
followed 1
also 1
The 1
Assyrian 1
Came 1
Down 1
and 1
other 1
declamatory 1
gems 1
Then 1
there 1
were 1
reading 1
exercises 1
and 1
a 1
spelling 1
fight 1
The 1
meagre 1
Latin 1
class 1
recited 1
with 1
honor 1
The 1
prime 1
feature 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
was 1
in 1
order 1
now 1
original 1
compositions 1
by 1
the 1
young 1
ladies 1
Each 1
in 1
her 1
turn 1
stepped 1
forward 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
platform 1
cleared 1
her 1
throat 1
held 1
up 1
her 1
manuscript 1
tied 1
with 1
dainty 1
ribbon 1
and 1
proceeded 1
to 1
read 1
with 1
labored 1
attention 1
to 1
expression 1
and 1
punctuation 1
The 1
themes 1
were 1
the 1
same 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
illuminated 1
upon 1
similar 1
occasions 1
by 1
their 1
mothers 1
before 1
them 1
their 1
grandmothers 1
and 1
doubtless 1
all 1
their 1
ancestors 1
in 1
the 1
female 1
line 1
clear 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
Crusades 1
Friendship 1
was 1
one 1
Memories 1
of 1
Other 1
Days 1
Religion 1
in 1
History 1
Dream 1
Land 1
The 1
Advantages 1
of 1
Culture 1
Forms 1
of 1
Political 1
Government 1
Compared 1
and 1
Contrasted 1
Melancholy 1
Filial 1
Love 1
Heart 1
Longings 1
etc 1
etc 1
A 1
prevalent 1
feature 1
in 1
these 1
compositions 1
was 1
a 1
nursed 1
and 1
petted 1
melancholy 1
another 1
was 1
a 1
wasteful 1
and 1
opulent 1
gush 1
of 1
fine 1
language 1
another 1
was 1
a 1
tendency 1
to 1
lug 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
ears 1
particularly 1
prized 1
words 1
and 1
phrases 1
until 1
they 1
were 1
worn 1
entirely 1
out 1
and 1
a 1
peculiarity 1
that 1
conspicuously 1
marked 1
and 1
marred 1
them 1
was 1
the 1
inveterate 1
and 1
intolerable 1
sermon 1
that 1
wagged 1
its 1
crippled 1
tail 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
each 1
and 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
No 1
matter 1
what 1
the 1
subject 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
brainracking 1
effort 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
squirm 1
it 1
into 1
some 1
aspect 1
or 1
other 1
that 1
the 1
moral 1
and 1
religious 1
mind 1
could 1
contemplate 1
with 1
edification 1
The 1
glaring 1
insincerity 1
of 1
these 1
sermons 1
was 1
not 1
sufficient 1
to 1
compass 1
the 1
banishment 1
of 1
the 1
fashion 1
from 1
the 1
schools 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
sufficient 1
today 1
it 1
never 1
will 1
be 1
sufficient 1
while 1
the 1
world 1
stands 1
perhaps 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
school 1
in 1
all 1
our 1
land 1
where 1
the 1
young 1
ladies 1
do 1
not 1
feel 1
obliged 1
to 1
close 1
their 1
compositions 1
with 1
a 1
sermon 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
that 1
the 1
sermon 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
frivolous 1
and 1
the 1
least 1
religious 1
girl 1
in 1
the 1
school 1
is 1
always 1
the 1
longest 1
and 1
the 1
most 1
relentlessly 1
pious 1
But 1
enough 1
of 1
this 1
Homely 1
truth 1
is 1
unpalatable 1
Let 1
us 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
Examination 1
The 1
first 1
composition 1
that 1
was 1
read 1
was 1
one 1
entitled 1
Is 1
this 1
then 1
Life 1
Perhaps 1
the 1
reader 1
can 1
endure 1
an 1
extract 1
from 1
it 1
In 1
the 1
common 1
walks 1
of 1
life 1
with 1
what 1
delightful 1
emotions 1
does 1
the 1
youthful 1
mind 1
look 1
forward 1
to 1
some 1
anticipated 1
scene 1
of 1
festivity 1
Imagination 1
is 1
busy 1
sketching 1
rose 1
tinted 1
pictures 1
of 1
joy 1
In 1
fancy 1
the 1
voluptuous 1
votary 1
of 1
fashion 1
sees 1
herself 1
amid 1
the 1
festive 1
throng 1
the 1
observed 1
of 1
all 1
observers 1
Her 1
graceful 1
form 1
arrayed 1
in 1
snowy 1
robes 1
is 1
whirling 1
through 1
the 1
mazes 1
of 1
the 1
joyous 1
dance 1
her 1
eye 1
is 1
brightest 1
her 1
step 1
is 1
lightest 1
in 1
the 1
gay 1
assembly 1
In 1
such 1
delicious 1
fancies 1
time 1
quickly 1
glides 1
by 1
and 1
the 1
welcome 1
hour 1
arrives 1
for 1
her 1
entrance 1
into 1
the 1
Elysian 1
world 1
of 1
which 1
she 1
has 1
had 1
such 1
bright 1
dreams 1
How 1
fairy 1
like 1
does 1
everything 1
appear 1
to 1
her 1
enchanted 1
vision 1
Each 1
new 1
scene 1
is 1
more 1
charming 1
than 1
the 1
last 1
But 1
after 1
a 1
while 1
she 1
finds 1
that 1
beneath 1
this 1
goodly 1
exterior 1
all 1
is 1
vanity 1
the 1
flattery 1
which 1
once 1
charmed 1
her 1
soul 1
now 1
grates 1
harshly 1
upon 1
her 1
ear 1
the 1
ballroom 1
has 1
lost 1
its 1
charms 1
and 1
with 1
wasted 1
health 1
and 1
imbittered 1
heart 1
she 1
turns 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
earthly 1
pleasures 1
cannot 1
satisfy 1
the 1
longings 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
And 1
so 1
forth 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
buzz 1
of 1
gratification 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
during 1
the 1
reading 1
accompanied 1
by 1
whispered 1
ejaculations 1
of 1
How 1
sweet 1
How 1
eloquent 1
So 1
true 1
etc 1
and 1
after 1
the 1
thing 1
had 1
closed 1
with 1
a 1
peculiarly 1
afflicting 1
sermon 1
the 1
applause 1
was 1
enthusiastic 1
Then 1
arose 1
a 1
slim 1
melancholy 1
girl 1
whose 1
face 1
had 1
the 1
interesting 1
paleness 1
that 1
comes 1
of 1
pills 1
and 1
indigestion 1
and 1
read 1
a 1
poem 1
Two 1
stanzas 1
of 1
it 1
will 1
do 1
A 1
MISSOURI 1
MAIDEN 1
S 1
FAREWELL 1
TO 1
ALABAMA 1
Alabama 1
goodbye 1
I 1
love 1
thee 1
well 1
But 1
yet 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
do 1
I 1
leave 1
thee 1
now 1
Sad 1
yes 1
sad 1
thoughts 1
of 1
thee 1
my 1
heart 1
doth 1
swell 1
And 1
burning 1
recollections 1
throng 1
my 1
brow 1
For 1
I 1
have 1
wandered 1
through 1
thy 1
flowery 1
woods 1
Have 1
roamed 1
and 1
read 1
near 1
Tallapoosa 1
s 1
stream 1
Have 1
listened 1
to 1
Tallassee 1
s 1
warring 1
floods 1
And 1
wooed 1
on 1
Coosa 1
s 1
side 1
Aurora 1
s 1
beam 1
Yet 1
shame 1
I 1
not 1
to 1
bear 1
an 1
o 1
erfull 1
heart 1
Nor 1
blush 1
to 1
turn 1
behind 1
my 1
tearful 1
eyes 1
Tis 1
from 1
no 1
stranger 1
land 1
I 1
now 1
must 1
part 1
Tis 1
to 1
no 1
strangers 1
left 1
I 1
yield 1
these 1
sighs 1
Welcome 1
and 1
home 1
were 1
mine 1
within 1
this 1
State 1
Whose 1
vales 1
I 1
leave 1
whose 1
spires 1
fade 1
fast 1
from 1
me 1
And 1
cold 1
must 1
be 1
mine 1
eyes 1
and 1
heart 1
and 1
tete 1
When 1
dear 1
Alabama 1
they 1
turn 1
cold 1
on 1
thee 1
There 1
were 1
very 1
few 1
there 1
who 1
knew 1
what 1
tete 1
meant 1
but 1
the 1
poem 1
was 1
very 1
satisfactory 1
nevertheless 1
Next 1
appeared 1
a 1
dark 1
complexioned 1
black 1
eyed 1
black 1
haired 1
young 1
lady 1
who 1
paused 1
an 1
impressive 1
moment 1
assumed 1
a 1
tragic 1
expression 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
read 1
in 1
a 1
measured 1
solemn 1
tone 1
A 1
VISION 1
Dark 1
and 1
tempestuous 1
was 1
night 1
Around 1
the 1
throne 1
on 1
high 1
not 1
a 1
single 1
star 1
quivered 1
but 1
the 1
deep 1
intonations 1
of 1
the 1
heavy 1
thunder 1
constantly 1
vibrated 1
upon 1
the 1
ear 1
whilst 1
the 1
terrific 1
lightning 1
revelled 1
in 1
angry 1
mood 1
through 1
the 1
cloudy 1
chambers 1
of 1
heaven 1
seeming 1
to 1
scorn 1
the 1
power 1
exerted 1
over 1
its 1
terror 1
by 1
the 1
illustrious 1
Franklin 1
Even 1
the 1
boisterous 1
winds 1
unanimously 1
came 1
forth 1
from 1
their 1
mystic 1
homes 1
and 1
blustered 1
about 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
enhance 1
by 1
their 1
aid 1
the 1
wildness 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
At 1
such 1
a 1
time 1
so 1
dark 1
so 1
dreary 1
for 1
human 1
sympathy 1
my 1
very 1
spirit 1
sighed 1
but 1
instead 1
thereof 1
My 1
dearest 1
friend 1
my 1
counsellor 1
my 1
comforter 1
and 1
guide 1
My 1
joy 1
in 1
grief 1
my 1
second 1
bliss 1
in 1
joy 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
side 1
She 1
moved 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
bright 1
beings 1
pictured 1
in 1
the 1
sunny 1
walks 1
of 1
fancy 1
s 1
Eden 1
by 1
the 1
romantic 1
and 1
young 1
a 1
queen 1
of 1
beauty 1
unadorned 1
save 1
by 1
her 1
own 1
transcendent 1
loveliness 1
So 1
soft 1
was 1
her 1
step 1
it 1
failed 1
to 1
make 1
even 1
a 1
sound 1
and 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
magical 1
thrill 1
imparted 1
by 1
her 1
genial 1
touch 1
as 1
other 1
unobtrusive 1
beauties 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
glided 1
away 1
unperceived 1
unsought 1
A 1
strange 1
sadness 1
rested 1
upon 1
her 1
features 1
like 1
icy 1
tears 1
upon 1
the 1
robe 1
of 1
December 1
as 1
she 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
contending 1
elements 1
without 1
and 1
bade 1
me 1
contemplate 1
the 1
two 1
beings 1
presented 1
This 1
nightmare 1
occupied 1
some 1
ten 1
pages 1
of 1
manuscript 1
and 1
wound 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
sermon 1
so 1
destructive 1
of 1
all 1
hope 1
to 1
non 1
Presbyterians 1
that 1
it 1
took 1
the 1
first 1
prize 1
This 1
composition 1
was 1
considered 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
very 1
finest 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
The 1
mayor 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
in 1
delivering 1
the 1
prize 1
to 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
it 1
made 1
a 1
warm 1
speech 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
far 1
the 1
most 1
eloquent 1
thing 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
and 1
that 1
Daniel 1
Webster 1
himself 1
might 1
well 1
be 1
proud 1
of 1
it 1
It 1
may 1
be 1
remarked 1
in 1
passing 1
that 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
compositions 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
word 1
beauteous 1
was 1
over 1
fondled 1
and 1
human 1
experience 1
referred 1
to 1
as 1
life 1
s 1
page 1
was 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
usual 1
average 1
Now 1
the 1
master 1
mellow 1
almost 1
to 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
geniality 1
put 1
his 1
chair 1
aside 1
turned 1
his 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
audience 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
draw 1
a 1
map 1
of 1
America 1
on 1
the 1
blackboard 1
to 1
exercise 1
the 1
geography 1
class 1
upon 1
But 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
sad 1
business 1
of 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
unsteady 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
smothered 1
titter 1
rippled 1
over 1
the 1
house 1
He 1
knew 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
and 1
set 1
himself 1
to 1
right 1
it 1
He 1
sponged 1
out 1
lines 1
and 1
remade 1
them 1
but 1
he 1
only 1
distorted 1
them 1
more 1
than 1
ever 1
and 1
the 1
tittering 1
was 1
more 1
pronounced 1
He 1
threw 1
his 1
entire 1
attention 1
upon 1
his 1
work 1
now 1
as 1
if 1
determined 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
put 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
mirth 1
He 1
felt 1
that 1
all 1
eyes 1
were 1
fastened 1
upon 1
him 1
he 1
imagined 1
he 1
was 1
succeeding 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
tittering 1
continued 1
it 1
even 1
manifestly 1
increased 1
And 1
well 1
it 1
might 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
garret 1
above 1
pierced 1
with 1
a 1
scuttle 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
down 1
through 1
this 1
scuttle 1
came 1
a 1
cat 1
suspended 1
around 1
the 1
haunches 1
by 1
a 1
string 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
rag 1
tied 1
about 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
jaws 1
to 1
keep 1
her 1
from 1
mewing 1
as 1
she 1
slowly 1
descended 1
she 1
curved 1
upward 1
and 1
clawed 1
at 1
the 1
string 1
she 1
swung 1
downward 1
and 1
clawed 1
at 1
the 1
intangible 1
air 1
The 1
tittering 1
rose 1
higher 1
and 1
higher 1
the 1
cat 1
was 1
within 1
six 1
inches 1
of 1
the 1
absorbed 1
teacher 1
s 1
head 1
down 1
down 1
a 1
little 1
lower 1
and 1
she 1
grabbed 1
his 1
wig 1
with 1
her 1
desperate 1
claws 1
clung 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
was 1
snatched 1
up 1
into 1
the 1
garret 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
with 1
her 1
trophy 1
still 1
in 1
her 1
possession 1
And 1
how 1
the 1
light 1
did 1
blaze 1
abroad 1
from 1
the 1
master 1
s 1
bald 1
pate 1
for 1
the 1
signpainter 1
s 1
boy 1
had 1
gilded 1
it 1
That 1
broke 1
up 1
the 1
meeting 1
The 1
boys 1
were 1
avenged 1
Vacation 1
had 1
come 1

CHAPTER 1
XXII 1
TOM 1
joined 1
the 1
new 1
order 1
of 1
Cadets 1
of 1
Temperance 1
being 1
attracted 1
by 1
the 1
showy 1
character 1
of 1
their 1
regalia 1
He 1
promised 1
to 1
abstain 1
from 1
smoking 1
chewing 1
and 1
profanity 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
remained 1
a 1
member 1
Now 1
he 1
found 1
out 1
a 1
new 1
thing 1
namely 1
that 1
to 1
promise 1
not 1
to 1
do 1
a 1
thing 1
is 1
the 1
surest 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
body 1
want 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
do 1
that 1
very 1
thing 1
Tom 1
soon 1
found 1
himself 1
tormented 1
with 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
drink 1
and 1
swear 1
the 1
desire 1
grew 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
intense 1
that 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
display 1
himself 1
in 1
his 1
red 1
sash 1
kept 1
him 1
from 1
withdrawing 1
from 1
the 1
order 1
Fourth 1
of 1
July 1
was 1
coming 1
but 1
he 1
soon 1
gave 1
that 1
up 1
gave 1
it 1
up 1
before 1
he 1
had 1
worn 1
his 1
shackles 1
over 1
forty 1
eight 1
hours 1
and 1
fixed 1
his 1
hopes 1
upon 1
old 1
Judge 1
Frazer 1
justice 1
of 1
the 1
peace 1
who 1
was 1
apparently 1
on 1
his 1
deathbed 1
and 1
would 1
have 1
a 1
big 1
public 1
funeral 1
since 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
high 1
an 1
official 1
During 1
three 1
days 1
Tom 1
was 1
deeply 1
concerned 1
about 1
the 1
Judge 1
s 1
condition 1
and 1
hungry 1
for 1
news 1
of 1
it 1
Sometimes 1
his 1
hopes 1
ran 1
high 1
so 1
high 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
his 1
regalia 1
and 1
practise 1
before 1
the 1
looking 1
glass 1
But 1
the 1
Judge 1
had 1
a 1
most 1
discouraging 1
way 1
of 1
fluctuating 1
At 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
pronounced 1
upon 1
the 1
mend 1
and 1
then 1
convalescent 1
Tom 1
was 1
disgusted 1
and 1
felt 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
injury 1
too 1
He 1
handed 1
in 1
his 1
resignation 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
Judge 1
suffered 1
a 1
relapse 1
and 1
died 1
Tom 1
resolved 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
trust 1
a 1
man 1
like 1
that 1
again 1
The 1
funeral 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
thing 1
The 1
Cadets 1
paraded 1
in 1
a 1
style 1
calculated 1
to 1
kill 1
the 1
late 1
member 1
with 1
envy 1
Tom 1
was 1
a 1
free 1
boy 1
again 1
however 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
that 1
He 1
could 1
drink 1
and 1
swear 1
now 1
but 1
found 1
to 1
his 1
surprise 1
that 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
The 1
simple 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
took 1
the 1
desire 1
away 1
and 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
it 1
Tom 1
presently 1
wondered 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
his 1
coveted 1
vacation 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
hang 1
a 1
little 1
heavily 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
He 1
attempted 1
a 1
diary 1
but 1
nothing 1
happened 1
during 1
three 1
days 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
abandoned 1
it 1
The 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
negro 1
minstrel 1
shows 1
came 1
to 1
town 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
sensation 1
Tom 1
and 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
got 1
up 1
a 1
band 1
of 1
performers 1
and 1
were 1
happy 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
Even 1
the 1
Glorious 1
Fourth 1
was 1
in 1
some 1
sense 1
a 1
failure 1
for 1
it 1
rained 1
hard 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
procession 1
in 1
consequence 1
and 1
the 1
greatest 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 1
Tom 1
supposed 1
Mr 1
Benton 1
an 1
actual 1
United 1
States 1
Senator 1
proved 1
an 1
overwhelming 1
disappointment 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
twenty 1
five 1
feet 1
high 1
nor 1
even 1
anywhere 1
in 1
the 1
neighborhood 1
of 1
it 1
A 1
circus 1
came 1
The 1
boys 1
played 1
circus 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
afterward 1
in 1
tents 1
made 1
of 1
rag 1
carpeting 1
admission 1
three 1
pins 1
for 1
boys 1
two 1
for 1
girls 1
and 1
then 1
circusing 1
was 1
abandoned 1
A 1
phrenologist 1
and 1
a 1
mesmerizer 1
came 1
and 1
went 1
again 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
village 1
duller 1
and 1
drearier 1
than 1
ever 1
There 1
were 1
some 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
parties 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
few 1
and 1
so 1
delightful 1
that 1
they 1
only 1
made 1
the 1
aching 1
voids 1
between 1
ache 1
the 1
harder 1
Becky 1
Thatcher 1
was 1
gone 1
to 1
her 1
Constantinople 1
home 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
her 1
parents 1
during 1
vacation 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
bright 1
side 1
to 1
life 1
anywhere 1
The 1
dreadful 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
was 1
a 1
chronic 1
misery 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
cancer 1
for 1
permanency 1
and 1
pain 1
Then 1
came 1
the 1
measles 1
During 1
two 1
long 1
weeks 1
Tom 1
lay 1
a 1
prisoner 1
dead 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
and 1
its 1
happenings 1
He 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
he 1
was 1
interested 1
in 1
nothing 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
upon 1
his 1
feet 1
at 1
last 1
and 1
moved 1
feebly 1
downtown 1
a 1
melancholy 1
change 1
had 1
come 1
over 1
everything 1
and 1
every 1
creature 1
There 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
revival 1
and 1
everybody 1
had 1
got 1
religion 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
adults 1
but 1
even 1
the 1
boys 1
and 1
girls 1
Tom 1
went 1
about 1
hoping 1
against 1
hope 1
for 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
one 1
blessed 1
sinful 1
face 1
but 1
disappointment 1
crossed 1
him 1
everywhere 1
He 1
found 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
studying 1
a 1
Testament 1
and 1
turned 1
sadly 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
depressing 1
spectacle 1
He 1
sought 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
and 1
found 1
him 1
visiting 1
the 1
poor 1
with 1
a 1
basket 1
of 1
tracts 1
He 1
hunted 1
up 1
Jim 1
Hollis 1
who 1
called 1
his 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
precious 1
blessing 1
of 1
his 1
late 1
measles 1
as 1
a 1
warning 1
Every 1
boy 1
he 1
encountered 1
added 1
another 1
ton 1
to 1
his 1
depression 1
and 1
when 1
in 1
desperation 1
he 1
flew 1
for 1
refuge 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
the 1
bosom 1
of 1
Huckleberry 1
Finn 1
and 1
was 1
received 1
with 1
a 1
Scriptural 1
quotation 1
his 1
heart 1
broke 1
and 1
he 1
crept 1
home 1
and 1
to 1
bed 1
realizing 1
that 1
he 1
alone 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
town 1
was 1
lost 1
forever 1
and 1
forever 1
And 1
that 1
night 1
there 1
came 1
on 1
a 1
terrific 1
storm 1
with 1
driving 1
rain 1
awful 1
claps 1
of 1
thunder 1
and 1
blinding 1
sheets 1
of 1
lightning 1
He 1
covered 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
the 1
bedclothes 1
and 1
waited 1
in 1
a 1
horror 1
of 1
suspense 1
for 1
his 1
doom 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
doubt 1
that 1
all 1
this 1
hubbub 1
was 1
about 1
him 1
He 1
believed 1
he 1
had 1
taxed 1
the 1
forbearance 1
of 1
the 1
powers 1
above 1
to 1
the 1
extremity 1
of 1
endurance 1
and 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
result 1
It 1
might 1
have 1
seemed 1
to 1
him 1
a 1
waste 1
of 1
pomp 1
and 1
ammunition 1
to 1
kill 1
a 1
bug 1
with 1
a 1
battery 1
of 1
artillery 1
but 1
there 1
seemed 1
nothing 1
incongruous 1
about 1
the 1
getting 1
up 1
such 1
an 1
expensive 1
thunderstorm 1
as 1
this 1
to 1
knock 1
the 1
turf 1
from 1
under 1
an 1
insect 1
like 1
himself 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
tempest 1
spent 1
itself 1
and 1
died 1
without 1
accomplishing 1
its 1
object 1
The 1
boy 1
s 1
first 1
impulse 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
grateful 1
and 1
reform 1
His 1
second 1
was 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
there 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
any 1
more 1
storms 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
doctors 1
were 1
back 1
Tom 1
had 1
relapsed 1
The 1
three 1
weeks 1
he 1
spent 1
on 1
his 1
back 1
this 1
time 1
seemed 1
an 1
entire 1
age 1
When 1
he 1
got 1
abroad 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
was 1
hardly 1
grateful 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
spared 1
remembering 1
how 1
lonely 1
was 1
his 1
estate 1
how 1
companionless 1
and 1
forlorn 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
drifted 1
listlessly 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
found 1
Jim 1
Hollis 1
acting 1
as 1
judge 1
in 1
a 1
juvenile 1
court 1
that 1
was 1
trying 1
a 1
cat 1
for 1
murder 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
her 1
victim 1
a 1
bird 1
He 1
found 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
and 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
up 1
an 1
alley 1
eating 1
a 1
stolen 1
melon 1
Poor 1
lads 1
they 1
like 1
Tom 1
had 1
suffered 1
a 1
relapse 1
CHAPTER 1
XXIII 1
AT 1
last 1
the 1
sleepy 1
atmosphere 1
was 1
stirred 1
and 1
vigorously 1
the 1
murder 1
trial 1
came 1
on 1
in 1
the 1
court 1
It 1
became 1
the 1
absorbing 1
topic 1
of 1
village 1
talk 1
immediately 1
Tom 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
it 1
Every 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
murder 1
sent 1
a 1
shudder 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
for 1
his 1
troubled 1
conscience 1
and 1
fears 1
almost 1
persuaded 1
him 1
that 1
these 1
remarks 1
were 1
put 1
forth 1
in 1
his 1
hearing 1
as 1
feelers 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
see 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
be 1
suspected 1
of 1
knowing 1
anything 1
about 1
the 1
murder 1
but 1
still 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
comfortable 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
this 1
gossip 1
It 1
kept 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
cold 1
shiver 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
He 1
took 1
Huck 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
place 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
talk 1
with 1
him 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
some 1
relief 1
to 1
unseal 1
his 1
tongue 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
to 1
divide 1
his 1
burden 1
of 1
distress 1
with 1
another 1
sufferer 1
Moreover 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
assure 1
himself 1
that 1
Huck 1
had 1
remained 1
discreet 1
Huck 1
have 1
you 1
ever 1
told 1
anybody 1
about 1
that 1
Bout 1
what 1
You 1
know 1
what 1
Oh 1
course 1
I 1
haven 1
t 1
Never 1
a 1
word 1
Never 1
a 1
solitary 1
word 1
so 1
help 1
me 1
What 1
makes 1
you 1
ask 1
Well 1
I 1
was 1
afeard 1
Why 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
we 1
wouldn 1
t 1
be 1
alive 1
two 1
days 1
if 1
that 1
got 1
found 1
out 1
You 1
know 1
that 1
Tom 1
felt 1
more 1
comfortable 1
After 1
a 1
pause 1
Huck 1
they 1
couldn 1
t 1
anybody 1
get 1
you 1
to 1
tell 1
could 1
they 1
Get 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
Why 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
that 1
halfbreed 1
devil 1
to 1
drownd 1
me 1
they 1
could 1
get 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
They 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
different 1
way 1
Well 1
that 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
then 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
re 1
safe 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
keep 1
mum 1
But 1
let 1
s 1
swear 1
again 1
anyway 1
It 1
s 1
more 1
surer 1
I 1
m 1
agreed 1
So 1
they 1
swore 1
again 1
with 1
dread 1
solemnities 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
talk 1
around 1
Huck 1
I 1
ve 1
heard 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
it 1
Talk 1
Well 1
it 1
s 1
just 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
It 1
keeps 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
sweat 1

That 1

just 1
the 1
same 1
way 1

on 1
round 1

I 1
reckon 1

goner 1
Don 1

for 1

Most 1

He 1

then 1
he 1
hain 1

Just 1
fishes 1

little 1
to 1
get 1
money 1
to 1
get 1
drunk 1
on 1
and 1
loafs 1

but 1
lord 1
we 1
all 1
do 1
that 1
leastways 1
most 1
of 1
us 1
preachers 1
and 1
such 1
like 1
But 1
he 1
s 1
kind 1
of 1
good 1
he 1

half 1
a 1
fish 1
once 1
when 1
there 1

t 1
enough 1
for 1
two 1
and 1
lots 1
of 1
times 1
he 1
s 1
kind 1
of 1
stood 1
by 1
me 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
luck 1
Well 1
he 1
s 1
mended 1
kites 1
for 1
me 1
Huck 1
and 1
knitted 1
hooks 1
on 1
to 1
my 1
line 1
I 1
wish 1
we 1
could 1
get 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
there 1
My 1
we 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
him 1
out 1
Tom 1
And 1
besides 1
twouldn 1
t 1
do 1
any 1
good 1
they 1
d 1
ketch 1
him 1
again 1
Yes 1
so 1
they 1
would 1
But 1
I 1
hate 1
to 1
hear 1
em 1
abuse 1
him 1
so 1
like 1
the 1
dickens 1
when 1
he 1
never 1
done 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
too 1
Tom 1
Lord 1
I 1
hear 1
em 1
say 1
he 1
s 1
the 1
bloodiest 1
looking 1
villain 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
and 1
they 1
wonder 1
he 1
wasn 1
t 1
ever 1
hung 1
before 1
Yes 1
they 1
talk 1
like 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
ve 1
heard 1
em 1
say 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
free 1
they 1
d 1
lynch 1
him 1
And 1
they 1
d 1
do 1
it 1
too 1
The 1
boys 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
talk 1
but 1
it 1
brought 1
them 1
little 1
comfort 1
As 1
the 1
twilight 1
drew 1
on 1
they 1
found 1
themselves 1
hanging 1
about 1
the 1
neighborhood 1
of 1
the 1
little 1
isolated 1
jail 1
perhaps 1
with 1
an 1
undefined 1
hope 1
that 1
something 1
would 1
happen 1
that 1
might 1
clear 1
away 1
their 1
difficulties 1
But 1
nothing 1
happened 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
angels 1
or 1
fairies 1
interested 1
in 1
this 1
luckless 1
captive 1
The 1
boys 1
did 1
as 1
they 1
had 1
often 1
done 1
before 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
cell 1
grating 1
and 1
gave 1
Potter 1
some 1
tobacco 1
and 1
matches 1
He 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
floor 1
and 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
guards 1
His 1
gratitude 1
for 1
their 1
gifts 1
had 1
always 1
smote 1
their 1
consciences 1
before 1
it 1
cut 1
deeper 1
than 1
ever 1
this 1
time 1
They 1
felt 1
cowardly 1
and 1
treacherous 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
degree 1
when 1
Potter 1
said 1
You 1
ve 1
been 1
mighty 1
good 1
to 1
me 1
boys 1
better 1
n 1
anybody 1
else 1
in 1
this 1
town 1
And 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
forget 1
it 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
Often 1
I 1
says 1
to 1
myself 1
says 1
I 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
mend 1
all 1
the 1
boys 1
kites 1
and 1
things 1
and 1
show 1
em 1
where 1
the 1
good 1
fishin 1
places 1
was 1
and 1
befriend 1
em 1
what 1
I 1
could 1
and 1
now 1
they 1
ve 1
all 1
forgot 1
old 1
Muff 1
when 1
he 1
s 1
in 1
trouble 1
but 1
Tom 1
don 1
t 1
and 1
Huck 1
don 1
t 1
they 1
don 1
t 1

I 1
and 1
I 1
don 1

them 1
Well 1
boys 1
I 1

an 1
awful 1
thing 1
drunk 1
and 1
crazy 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
I 1
account 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
now 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
swing 1
for 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
s 1
right 1
Right 1
and 1
best 1
too 1
I 1
reckon 1
hope 1
so 1
anyway 1
Well 1
we 1
won 1
t 1
talk 1
about 1
that 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
you 1
feel 1
bad 1
you 1
ve 1
befriended 1
me 1
But 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
say 1
is 1
don 1

Little 1

and 1

but 1
they 1

Muff 1
Potter 1
a 1
power 1
and 1
they 1
d 1
help 1
him 1
more 1
if 1
they 1
could 1
Tom 1
went 1
home 1
miserable 1
and 1
his 1
dreams 1
that 1
night 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
horrors 1
The 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
he 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
courtroom 1
drawn 1
by 1
an 1
almost 1
irresistible 1
impulse 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
but 1
forcing 1
himself 1
to 1
stay 1
out 1
Huck 1
was 1
having 1
the 1
same 1
experience 1
They 1
studiously 1
avoided 1
each 1
other 1
Each 1
wandered 1
away 1
from 1
time 1
to 1
time 1
but 1
the 1
same 1
dismal 1
fascination 1
always 1
brought 1
them 1
back 1
presently 1
Tom 1
kept 1
his 1
ears 1
open 1
when 1
idlers 1
sauntered 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
courtroom 1
but 1
invariably 1
heard 1
distressing 1
news 1
the 1
toils 1
were 1
closing 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
relentlessly 1
around 1
poor 1
Potter 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
day 1
the 1
village 1
talk 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
effect 1
that 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
evidence 1
stood 1
firm 1
and 1
unshaken 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
slightest 1
question 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
jury 1
s 1
verdict 1
would 1
be 1
Tom 1
was 1
out 1
late 1
that 1
night 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
bed 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
He 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
tremendous 1
state 1
of 1
excitement 1
It 1
was 1
hours 1
before 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
sleep 1
All 1
the 1
village 1
flocked 1
to 1
the 1
courthouse 1
the 1
next 1
morning 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
great 1
day 1
Both 1
sexes 1
were 1
about 1
equally 1
represented 1
in 1
the 1
packed 1
audience 1
After 1
a 1
long 1
wait 1
the 1
jury 1
filed 1
in 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
places 1
shortly 1
afterward 1
Potter 1
pale 1
and 1
haggard 1
timid 1
and 1
hopeless 1
was 1
brought 1
in 1
with 1
chains 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
seated 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
curious 1
eyes 1
could 1
stare 1
at 1
him 1
no 1
less 1
conspicuous 1
was 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
stolid 1
as 1
ever 1
There 1
was 1
another 1
pause 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
judge 1
arrived 1
and 1
the 1
sheriff 1
proclaimed 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
the 1
court 1
The 1
usual 1
whisperings 1
among 1
the 1
lawyers 1
and 1
gathering 1
together 1
of 1
papers 1
followed 1
These 1
details 1
and 1
accompanying 1
delays 1
worked 1
up 1
an 1
atmosphere 1
of 1
preparation 1
that 1
was 1
as 1
impressive 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
fascinating 1
Now 1
a 1
witness 1
was 1
called 1
who 1
testified 1
that 1
he 1
found 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
washing 1
in 1
the 1
brook 1
at 1
an 1
early 1
hour 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
that 1
the 1
murder 1
was 1
discovered 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
immediately 1
sneaked 1
away 1
After 1
some 1
further 1
questioning 1
counsel 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
said 1
Take 1
the 1
witness 1
The 1
prisoner 1
raised 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
but 1
dropped 1
them 1
again 1
when 1
his 1
own 1
counsel 1
said 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
questions 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
The 1
next 1
witness 1
proved 1
the 1
finding 1
of 1
the 1
knife 1
near 1
the 1
corpse 1
Counsel 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
said 1
Take 1
the 1
witness 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
questions 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
Potter 1
s 1
lawyer 1
replied 1
A 1
third 1
witness 1
swore 1
he 1
had 1
often 1
seen 1
the 1
knife 1
in 1
Potter 1
s 1
possession 1
Take 1
the 1
witness 1
Counsel 1
for 1
Potter 1
declined 1
to 1
question 1
him 1
The 1
faces 1
of 1
the 1
audience 1
began 1
to 1
betray 1
annoyance 1
Did 1
this 1
attorney 1
mean 1
to 1
throw 1
away 1
his 1
client 1
s 1
life 1
without 1
an 1
effort 1
Several 1
witnesses 1
deposed 1
concerning 1
Potter 1
s 1
guilty 1
behavior 1
when 1
brought 1
to 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
murder 1
They 1
were 1
allowed 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
stand 1
without 1
being 1
cross 1
questioned 1
Every 1
detail 1
of 1
the 1
damaging 1
circumstances 1
that 1
occurred 1
in 1
the 1
graveyard 1
upon 1
that 1
morning 1
which 1
all 1
present 1
remembered 1
so 1
well 1
was 1
brought 1
out 1
by 1
credible 1
witnesses 1
but 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
cross 1
examined 1
by 1
Potter 1
s 1
lawyer 1
The 1
perplexity 1
and 1
dissatisfaction 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
expressed 1
itself 1
in 1
murmurs 1
and 1
provoked 1
a 1
reproof 1
from 1
the 1
bench 1
Counsel 1
for 1
the 1
prosecution 1
now 1
said 1
By 1
the 1
oaths 1
of 1
citizens 1
whose 1
simple 1
word 1
is 1
above 1
suspicion 1
we 1
have 1
fastened 1
this 1
awful 1
crime 1
beyond 1
all 1
possibility 1
of 1
question 1
upon 1
the 1
unhappy 1
prisoner 1
at 1
the 1
bar 1
We 1
rest 1
our 1
case 1
here 1
A 1
groan 1
escaped 1
from 1
poor 1
Potter 1
and 1
he 1
put 1
his 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
rocked 1
his 1
body 1
softly 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
while 1
a 1
painful 1
silence 1
reigned 1
in 1
the 1
courtroom 1
Many 1
men 1
were 1
moved 1
and 1
many 1
women 1
s 1
compassion 1
testified 1
itself 1
in 1
tears 1
Counsel 1
for 1
the 1
defence 1
rose 1
and 1
said 1
Your 1
honor 1
in 1
our 1
remarks 1
at 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
this 1
trial 1
we 1
foreshadowed 1
our 1
purpose 1
to 1
prove 1
that 1
our 1
client 1
did 1
this 1
fearful 1
deed 1
while 1
under 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
a 1
blind 1
and 1
irresponsible 1
delirium 1
produced 1
by 1
drink 1
We 1
have 1
changed 1
our 1
mind 1
We 1
shall 1
not 1
offer 1
that 1
plea 1
Then 1
to 1
the 1
clerk 1
Call 1
Thomas 1
Sawyer 1
A 1
puzzled 1
amazement 1
awoke 1
in 1
every 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
not 1
even 1
excepting 1
Potter 1
s 1
Every 1
eye 1
fastened 1
itself 1
with 1
wondering 1
interest 1
upon 1
Tom 1
as 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
place 1
upon 1
the 1
stand 1
The 1
boy 1
looked 1
wild 1
enough 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
badly 1
scared 1
The 1
oath 1
was 1
administered 1
Thomas 1
Sawyer 1
where 1
were 1
you 1
on 1
the 1
seventeenth 1
of 1
June 1
about 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
midnight 1
Tom 1
glanced 1
at 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
iron 1
face 1
and 1
his 1
tongue 1
failed 1
him 1
The 1
audience 1
listened 1
breathless 1
but 1
the 1
words 1
refused 1
to 1
come 1
After 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
however 1
the 1
boy 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
of 1
his 1
strength 1
back 1
and 1
managed 1
to 1
put 1
enough 1
of 1
it 1
into 1
his 1
voice 1
to 1
make 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
hear 1
In 1
the 1
graveyard 1
A 1
little 1
bit 1
louder 1
please 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
afraid 1
You 1
were 1
In 1
the 1
graveyard 1
A 1
contemptuous 1
smile 1
flitted 1
across 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
face 1
Were 1
you 1
anywhere 1
near 1
Horse 1
Williams 1
grave 1
Yes 1
sir 1
Speak 1
up 1
just 1
a 1
trifle 1
louder 1
How 1
near 1
were 1
you 1
Near 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
you 1
Were 1
you 1
hidden 1
or 1
not 1
I 1
was 1
hid 1
Where 1
Behind 1
the 1
elms 1
that 1
s 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
grave 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
gave 1
a 1
barely 1
perceptible 1
start 1
Any 1
one 1
with 1
you 1
Yes 1
sir 1
I 1
went 1
there 1
with 1
Wait 1
wait 1
a 1
moment 1
Never 1
mind 1
mentioning 1
your 1
companion 1
s 1
name 1
We 1
will 1
produce 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
proper 1
time 1
Did 1
you 1
carry 1
anything 1
there 1
with 1
you 1
Tom 1
hesitated 1
and 1
looked 1
confused 1
Speak 1
out 1
my 1
boy 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
diffident 1
The 1
truth 1
is 1
always 1
respectable 1
What 1
did 1
you 1
take 1
there 1
Only 1
a 1
a 1
dead 1
cat 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
ripple 1
of 1
mirth 1
which 1
the 1
court 1
checked 1
We 1
will 1
produce 1
the 1
skeleton 1
of 1
that 1
cat 1
Now 1
my 1
boy 1
tell 1
us 1
everything 1
that 1
occurred 1
tell 1
it 1
in 1
your 1
own 1
way 1
don 1
t 1
skip 1
anything 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
afraid 1
Tom 1
began 1
hesitatingly 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
as 1
he 1
warmed 1
to 1
his 1
subject 1
his 1
words 1
flowed 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
easily 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
every 1
sound 1
ceased 1
but 1
his 1
own 1
voice 1
every 1
eye 1
fixed 1
itself 1
upon 1
him 1
with 1
parted 1
lips 1
and 1
bated 1
breath 1
the 1
audience 1
hung 1
upon 1
his 1
words 1
taking 1
no 1
note 1
of 1
time 1
rapt 1
in 1
the 1
ghastly 1
fascinations 1
of 1
the 1
tale 1
The 1
strain 1
upon 1
pent 1
emotion 1
reached 1
its 1
climax 1
when 1
the 1
boy 1
said 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
doctor 1
fetched 1
the 1
board 1
around 1
and 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
fell 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
jumped 1
with 1
the 1
knife 1
and 1
Crash 1
Quick 1
as 1
lightning 1
the 1
halfbreed 1
sprang 1
for 1
a 1
window 1
tore 1
his 1
way 1
through 1
all 1
opposers 1
and 1
was 1
gone 1
CHAPTER 1
XXIV 1
TOM 1
was 1
a 1
glittering 1
hero 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
pet 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
the 1
envy 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
His 1
name 1
even 1
went 1
into 1
immortal 1
print 1
for 1
the 1
village 1
paper 1
magnified 1
him 1
There 1
were 1
some 1
that 1
believed 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
President 1
yet 1
if 1
he 1
escaped 1
hanging 1
As 1
usual 1
the 1
fickle 1
unreasoning 1
world 1
took 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
to 1
its 1
bosom 1
and 1
fondled 1
him 1
as 1
lavishly 1
as 1
it 1
had 1
abused 1
him 1
before 1
But 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
conduct 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
s 1
credit 1
therefore 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
well 1
to 1
find 1
fault 1
with 1
it 1
Tom 1
s 1
days 1
were 1
days 1
of 1
splendor 1
and 1
exultation 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
his 1
nights 1
were 1
seasons 1
of 1
horror 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
infested 1
all 1
his 1
dreams 1
and 1
always 1
with 1
doom 1
in 1
his 1
eye 1
Hardly 1
any 1
temptation 1
could 1
persuade 1
the 1
boy 1
to 1
stir 1
abroad 1
after 1
nightfall 1
Poor 1
Huck 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
state 1
of 1
wretchedness 1
and 1
terror 1
for 1
Tom 1
had 1
told 1
the 1
whole 1
story 1
to 1
the 1
lawyer 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
the 1
great 1
day 1
of 1
the 1
trial 1
and 1
Huck 1
was 1
sore 1
afraid 1
that 1
his 1
share 1
in 1
the 1
business 1
might 1
leak 1
out 1
yet 1
notwithstanding 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
flight 1
had 1
saved 1
him 1
the 1
suffering 1
of 1
testifying 1
in 1
court 1
The 1
poor 1
fellow 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
attorney 1
to 1
promise 1
secrecy 1
but 1
what 1
of 1
that 1
Since 1
Tom 1
s 1
harassed 1
conscience 1
had 1
managed 1
to 1
drive 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
lawyer 1
s 1
house 1
by 1
night 1
and 1
wring 1
a 1
dread 1
tale 1
from 1
lips 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
sealed 1
with 1
the 1
dismalest 1
and 1
most 1
formidable 1
of 1
oaths 1
Huck 1
s 1
confidence 1
in 1
the 1
human 1
race 1
was 1
wellnigh 1
obliterated 1
Daily 1
Muff 1
Potter 1
s 1
gratitude 1
made 1
Tom 1
glad 1
he 1
had 1
spoken 1
but 1
nightly 1
he 1
wished 1
he 1
had 1
sealed 1
up 1
his 1
tongue 1
Half 1
the 1
time 1
Tom 1
was 1
afraid 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
would 1
never 1
be 1
captured 1
the 1
other 1
half 1
he 1
was 1
afraid 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
He 1
felt 1
sure 1
he 1
never 1
could 1
draw 1
a 1
safe 1
breath 1
again 1
until 1
that 1
man 1
was 1
dead 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
corpse 1
Rewards 1
had 1
been 1
offered 1
the 1
country 1
had 1
been 1
scoured 1
but 1
no 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
was 1
found 1
One 1
of 1
those 1
omniscient 1
and 1
aweinspiring 1
marvels 1
a 1
detective 1
came 1
up 1
from 1
St 1
Louis 1
moused 1
around 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
looked 1
wise 1
and 1
made 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
astounding 1
success 1
which 1
members 1
of 1
that 1
craft 1
usually 1
achieve 1
That 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
he 1
found 1
a 1
clew 1
But 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
hang 1
a 1
clew 1
for 1
murder 1
and 1
so 1
after 1
that 1
detective 1
had 1
got 1
through 1
and 1
gone 1
home 1
Tom 1
felt 1
just 1
as 1
insecure 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
before 1
The 1
slow 1
days 1
drifted 1
on 1
and 1
each 1
left 1
behind 1
it 1
a 1
slightly 1
lightened 1
weight 1
of 1
apprehension 1
CHAPTER 1
XXV 1
THERE 1
comes 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
every 1
rightly 1
constructed 1
boy 1
s 1
life 1
when 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
raging 1
desire 1
to 1
go 1
somewhere 1
and 1
dig 1
for 1
hidden 1
treasure 1
This 1
desire 1
suddenly 1
came 1
upon 1
Tom 1
one 1
day 1
He 1
sallied 1
out 1
to 1
find 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
but 1
failed 1
of 1
success 1
Next 1
he 1
sought 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
fishing 1
Presently 1
he 1
stumbled 1
upon 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
the 1
Red 1
Handed 1
Huck 1
would 1
answer 1
Tom 1
took 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
private 1
place 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
matter 1
to 1
him 1
confidentially 1
Huck 1
was 1
willing 1
Huck 1
was 1
always 1
willing 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
hand 1
in 1
any 1
enterprise 1
that 1
offered 1
entertainment 1
and 1
required 1
no 1
capital 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
troublesome 1
superabundance 1
of 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
time 1
which 1
is 1
not 1
money 1
Where 1
ll 1
we 1
dig 1
said 1
Huck 1
Oh 1
most 1
anywhere 1
Why 1
is 1
it 1
hid 1
all 1
around 1
No 1
indeed 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
It 1
s 1
hid 1
in 1
mighty 1
particular 1
places 1
Huck 1
sometimes 1
on 1
islands 1
sometimes 1
in 1
rotten 1
chests 1
under 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
limb 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
dead 1
tree 1
just 1
where 1
the 1
shadow 1
falls 1
at 1
midnight 1
but 1
mostly 1
under 1
the 1
floor 1
in 1
ha 1
nted 1
houses 1
Who 1
hides 1
it 1
Why 1
robbers 1
of 1
course 1
who 1
d 1
you 1
reckon 1
Sunday 1
school 1
sup 1
rintendents 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
If 1
twas 1
mine 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
hide 1
it 1
I 1
d 1
spend 1
it 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
So 1
would 1
I 1
But 1
robbers 1
don 1
t 1
do 1
that 1
way 1
They 1
always 1
hide 1
it 1
and 1
leave 1
it 1
there 1
Don 1
t 1
they 1
come 1
after 1
it 1
any 1
more 1
No 1
they 1
think 1
they 1
will 1
but 1
they 1
generally 1
forget 1
the 1
marks 1
or 1
else 1
they 1
die 1
Anyway 1
it 1
lays 1
there 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
and 1
gets 1
rusty 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
somebody 1
finds 1
an 1
old 1
yellow 1
paper 1
that 1
tells 1
how 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
marks 1
a 1
paper 1
that 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
ciphered 1
over 1
about 1
a 1
week 1
because 1

mostly 1
signs 1
and 1

bury 1
it 1
as 1
deep 1
as 1
this 1
Sometimes 1
not 1
always 1
Not 1
generally 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
haven 1
t 1
got 1
the 1
right 1
place 1
So 1
they 1
chose 1
a 1
new 1
spot 1
and 1
began 1
again 1
The 1
labor 1
dragged 1
a 1
little 1
but 1
still 1
they 1
made 1
progress 1
They 1
pegged 1
away 1
in 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
Finally 1
Huck 1
leaned 1
on 1
his 1
shovel 1
swabbed 1
the 1
beaded 1
drops 1
from 1
his 1
brow 1
with 1
his 1
sleeve 1
and 1
said 1
Where 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
dig 1
next 1
after 1
we 1
get 1
this 1
one 1
I 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
we 1
ll 1
tackle 1
the 1
old 1
tree 1
that 1
s 1
over 1
yonder 1
on 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
I 1
reckon 1
that 1
ll 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
one 1
But 1
won 1
t 1
the 1
widow 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
from 1
us 1
Tom 1
It 1
s 1
on 1
her 1
land 1
She 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
Maybe 1
she 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
try 1
it 1
once 1
Whoever 1
finds 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
hid 1
treasures 1
it 1
belongs 1
to 1
him 1
It 1
don 1
t 1
make 1
any 1
difference 1
whose 1
land 1
it 1
s 1
on 1
That 1
was 1
satisfactory 1
The 1
work 1
went 1
on 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Huck 1
said 1
Blame 1
it 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
place 1
again 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
It 1
is 1
mighty 1
curious 1
Huck 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
understand 1
it 1
Sometimes 1
witches 1
interfere 1
I 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
that 1
s 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
trouble 1
now 1
Shucks 1
Witches 1
ain 1
t 1
got 1
no 1
power 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
Well 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
Oh 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
What 1
a 1
blamed 1
lot 1
of 1
fools 1
we 1
are 1
You 1
got 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
limb 1
falls 1
at 1
midnight 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
where 1
you 1
dig 1
Then 1
consound 1
it 1
we 1
ve 1
fooled 1
away 1
all 1
this 1
work 1
for 1
nothing 1
Now 1
hang 1
it 1
all 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
It 1
s 1
an 1
awful 1
long 1
way 1
Can 1
you 1
get 1
out 1
I 1
bet 1
I 1
will 1
We 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
tonight 1
too 1
because 1
if 1
somebody 1
sees 1
these 1
holes 1
they 1
ll 1
know 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
what 1
s 1
here 1
and 1
they 1
ll 1
go 1
for 1
it 1
Well 1
I 1
ll 1
come 1
around 1
and 1
maow 1
tonight 1
All 1
right 1
Let 1
s 1
hide 1
the 1
tools 1
in 1
the 1
bushes 1
The 1
boys 1
were 1
there 1
that 1
night 1
about 1
the 1
appointed 1
time 1
They 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
shadow 1
waiting 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
lonely 1
place 1
and 1
an 1
hour 1
made 1
solemn 1
by 1
old 1
traditions 1
Spirits 1
whispered 1
in 1
the 1
rustling 1
leaves 1
ghosts 1
lurked 1
in 1
the 1
murky 1
nooks 1
the 1
deep 1
baying 1
of 1
a 1
hound 1
floated 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
distance 1
an 1
owl 1
answered 1
with 1
his 1
sepulchral 1
note 1
The 1
boys 1
were 1
subdued 1
by 1
these 1
solemnities 1
and 1
talked 1
little 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
they 1
judged 1
that 1
twelve 1
had 1
come 1
they 1
marked 1
where 1
the 1
shadow 1
fell 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
dig 1
Their 1
hopes 1
commenced 1
to 1
rise 1
Their 1
interest 1
grew 1
stronger 1
and 1
their 1
industry 1
kept 1
pace 1
with 1
it 1
The 1
hole 1
deepened 1
and 1
still 1
deepened 1
but 1
every 1
time 1
their 1
hearts 1
jumped 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
pick 1
strike 1
upon 1
something 1
they 1
only 1
suffered 1
a 1
new 1
disappointment 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
stone 1
or 1
a 1
chunk 1
At 1
last 1
Tom 1
said 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
any 1
use 1
Huck 1
we 1
re 1
wrong 1
again 1
Well 1
but 1
we 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
wrong 1
We 1
spotted 1
the 1
shadder 1
to 1
a 1
dot 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
but 1
then 1
there 1
s 1
another 1
thing 1
What 1
s 1
that 1
Why 1
we 1
only 1
guessed 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
Like 1
enough 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
or 1
too 1
early 1
Huck 1
dropped 1
his 1
shovel 1
That 1
s 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
very 1
trouble 1
We 1
got 1
to 1
give 1
this 1
one 1
up 1
We 1
can 1
t 1
ever 1
tell 1
the 1
right 1
time 1
and 1
besides 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
thing 1
s 1
too 1
awful 1
here 1
this 1
time 1
of 1
night 1
with 1
witches 1
and 1
ghosts 1
a 1
fluttering 1
around 1
so 1
I 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
something 1
s 1
behind 1
me 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
I 1
m 1
afeard 1
to 1
turn 1
around 1
becuz 1
maybe 1
there 1
s 1
others 1
in 1
front 1
a 1
waiting 1
for 1
a 1
chance 1
I 1
been 1
creeping 1
all 1
over 1
ever 1
since 1
I 1
got 1
here 1
Well 1
I 1
ve 1
been 1
pretty 1
much 1
so 1
too 1
Huck 1
They 1
most 1
always 1
put 1
in 1
a 1
dead 1
man 1
when 1
they 1
bury 1
a 1
treasure 1
under 1
a 1
tree 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
for 1
it 1
Lordy 1
Yes 1
they 1
do 1
I 1
ve 1
always 1
heard 1
that 1
Tom 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
fool 1
around 1
much 1
where 1
there 1
s 1
dead 1
people 1
A 1
body 1
s 1
bound 1
to 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
with 1
em 1
sure 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
stir 1
em 1
up 1
either 1
S 1
pose 1
this 1
one 1
here 1
was 1
to 1
stick 1
his 1
skull 1
out 1
and 1
say 1
something 1
Don 1
t 1
Tom 1
It 1
s 1
awful 1
Well 1
it 1
just 1
is 1
Huck 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
feel 1
comfortable 1
a 1
bit 1
Say 1
Tom 1
let 1
s 1
give 1
this 1
place 1
up 1
and 1
try 1
somewheres 1
else 1
All 1
right 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
better 1
What 1
ll 1
it 1
be 1
Tom 1
considered 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
The 1
ha 1
nted 1
house 1
That 1
s 1
it 1
Blame 1
it 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
ha 1
nted 1
houses 1
Tom 1
Why 1
they 1
re 1
a 1
dern 1
sight 1
worse 1
n 1
dead 1
people 1
Dead 1
people 1
might 1
talk 1
maybe 1
but 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
come 1
sliding 1
around 1
in 1
a 1
shroud 1
when 1
you 1
ain 1
t 1
noticing 1
and 1
peep 1
over 1
your 1
shoulder 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
and 1
grit 1
their 1
teeth 1
the 1
way 1
a 1
ghost 1
does 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
stand 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
as 1
that 1
Tom 1
nobody 1
could 1
Yes 1
but 1
Huck 1
ghosts 1
don 1
t 1
travel 1
around 1
only 1
at 1
night 1
They 1
won 1
t 1
hender 1
us 1
from 1
digging 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
Well 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
But 1
you 1
know 1
mighty 1
well 1
people 1
don 1
t 1
go 1
about 1
that 1
ha 1
nted 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
day 1
nor 1
the 1
night 1
Well 1
that 1
s 1
mostly 1
because 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
where 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
been 1
murdered 1
anyway 1
but 1
nothing 1
s 1
ever 1
been 1
seen 1
around 1
that 1
house 1
except 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
just 1
some 1
blue 1
lights 1
slipping 1
by 1
the 1
windows 1
no 1
regular 1
ghosts 1
Well 1
where 1
you 1
see 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
blue 1
lights 1
flickering 1
around 1
Tom 1
you 1
can 1
bet 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
ghost 1
mighty 1
close 1
behind 1
it 1
It 1
stands 1
to 1
reason 1
Becuz 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
anybody 1
but 1
ghosts 1
use 1
em 1
Yes 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
But 1
anyway 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
come 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
so 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
our 1
being 1
afeard 1
Well 1
all 1
right 1
We 1
ll 1
tackle 1
the 1
ha 1
nted 1
house 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
but 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
s 1
taking 1
chances 1
They 1
had 1
started 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
There 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
moonlit 1
valley 1
below 1
them 1
stood 1
the 1
ha 1
nted 1
house 1
utterly 1
isolated 1
its 1
fences 1
gone 1
long 1
ago 1
rank 1
weeds 1
smothering 1
the 1
very 1
doorsteps 1
the 1
chimney 1
crumbled 1
to 1
ruin 1
the 1
window 1
sashes 1
vacant 1
a 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
roof 1
caved 1
in 1
The 1
boys 1
gazed 1
awhile 1
half 1
expecting 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
blue 1
light 1
flit 1
past 1
a 1
window 1
then 1
talking 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
tone 1
as 1
befitted 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
the 1
circumstances 1
they 1
struck 1
far 1
off 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
give 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
a 1
wide 1
berth 1
and 1
took 1
their 1
way 1
homeward 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
that 1
adorned 1
the 1
rearward 1
side 1
of 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
CHAPTER 1
XVI 1
ABOUT 1
noon 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
boys 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
tree 1
they 1
had 1
come 1
for 1
their 1
tools 1
Tom 1
was 1
impatient 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
Huck 1
was 1
measurably 1
so 1
also 1
but 1
suddenly 1
said 1
Lookyhere 1
Tom 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
day 1
it 1
is 1
Tom 1
mentally 1
ran 1
over 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
week 1
and 1
then 1
quickly 1
lifted 1
his 1
eyes 1
with 1
a 1
startled 1
look 1
in 1
them 1
My 1
I 1
never 1
once 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
Huck 1
Well 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
neither 1
but 1
all 1
at 1
once 1
it 1
popped 1
onto 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
Friday 1
Blame 1
it 1
a 1
body 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
too 1
careful 1
Huck 1
We 1
might 1
a 1
got 1
into 1
an 1
awful 1
scrape 1
tackling 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
on 1
a 1
Friday 1
Might 1
Better 1
say 1
we 1
would 1
There 1
s 1
some 1
lucky 1
days 1
maybe 1
but 1
Friday 1
ain 1
t 1
Any 1
fool 1
knows 1
that 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
reckon 1
you 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
that 1
found 1
it 1
out 1
Huck 1
Well 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
I 1
was 1
did 1
I 1
And 1
Friday 1
ain 1
t 1
all 1
neither 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
rotten 1
bad 1
dream 1
last 1
night 1
dreampt 1
about 1
rats 1
No 1
Sure 1
sign 1
of 1
trouble 1
Did 1
they 1
fight 1
No 1
Well 1
that 1
s 1
good 1
Huck 1
When 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
fight 1
it 1
s 1
only 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
there 1
s 1
trouble 1
around 1
you 1
know 1
All 1
we 1
got 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
to 1
look 1
mighty 1
sharp 1
and 1
keep 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
We 1
ll 1
drop 1
this 1
thing 1
for 1
today 1
and 1
play 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
Robin 1
Hood 1
Huck 1
No 1
Who 1
s 1
Robin 1
Hood 1
Why 1
he 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
men 1
that 1
was 1
ever 1
in 1
England 1
and 1
the 1
best 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
robber 1
Cracky 1
I 1
wisht 1
I 1
was 1
Who 1
did 1
he 1
rob 1
Only 1
sheriffs 1
and 1
bishops 1
and 1
rich 1
people 1
and 1
kings 1
and 1
such 1
like 1
But 1
he 1
never 1
bothered 1
the 1
poor 1
He 1
loved 1
em 1
He 1
always 1
divided 1
up 1
with 1
em 1
perfectly 1
square 1
Well 1
he 1
must 1
a 1
been 1
a 1
brick 1
I 1
bet 1
you 1
he 1
was 1
Huck 1
Oh 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
noblest 1
man 1
that 1
ever 1
was 1
They 1
ain 1
t 1
any 1
such 1
men 1
now 1
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
He 1
could 1
lick 1
any 1
man 1
in 1
England 1
with 1
one 1
hand 1
tied 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
could 1
take 1
his 1
yew 1
bow 1
and 1
plug 1
a 1
ten 1
cent 1
piece 1
every 1
time 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
a 1
half 1
What 1
s 1
a 1
yew 1
bow 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
It 1
s 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
bow 1
of 1
course 1
And 1
if 1
he 1
hit 1
that 1
dime 1
only 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
he 1
would 1
set 1
down 1
and 1
cry 1
and 1
curse 1
But 1
we 1
ll 1
play 1
Robin 1
Hood 1
it 1
s 1
nobby 1
fun 1
I 1
ll 1
learn 1
you 1
I 1
m 1
agreed 1
So 1
they 1
played 1
Robin 1
Hood 1
all 1
the 1
afternoon 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
casting 1
a 1
yearning 1
eye 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
and 1
passing 1
a 1
remark 1
about 1
the 1
morrow 1
s 1
prospects 1
and 1
possibilities 1
there 1
As 1
the 1
sun 1
began 1
to 1
sink 1
into 1
the 1
west 1
they 1
took 1
their 1
way 1
homeward 1
athwart 1
the 1
long 1
shadows 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
soon 1
were 1
buried 1
from 1
sight 1
in 1
the 1
forests 1
of 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
On 1
Saturday 1
shortly 1
after 1
noon 1
the 1
boys 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
tree 1
again 1
They 1
had 1
a 1
smoke 1
and 1
a 1
chat 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
and 1
then 1
dug 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
their 1
last 1
hole 1
not 1
with 1
great 1
hope 1
but 1
merely 1
because 1
Tom 1
said 1
there 1
were 1
so 1
many 1
cases 1
where 1
people 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
a 1
treasure 1
after 1
getting 1
down 1
within 1
six 1
inches 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
then 1
somebody 1
else 1
had 1
come 1
along 1
and 1
turned 1
it 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
single 1
thrust 1
of 1
a 1
shovel 1
The 1
thing 1
failed 1
this 1
time 1
however 1
so 1
the 1
boys 1
shouldered 1
their 1
tools 1
and 1
went 1
away 1
feeling 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
trifled 1
with 1
fortune 1
but 1
had 1
fulfilled 1
all 1
the 1
requirements 1
that 1
belong 1
to 1
the 1
business 1
of 1
treasure 1
hunting 1
When 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
so 1
weird 1
and 1
grisly 1
about 1
the 1
dead 1
silence 1
that 1
reigned 1
there 1
under 1
the 1
baking 1
sun 1
and 1
something 1
so 1
depressing 1
about 1
the 1
loneliness 1
and 1
desolation 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
afraid 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
venture 1
in 1
Then 1
they 1
crept 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
trembling 1
peep 1
They 1
saw 1
a 1
weedgrown 1
floorless 1
room 1
unplastered 1
an 1
ancient 1
fireplace 1
vacant 1
windows 1
a 1
ruinous 1
staircase 1
and 1
here 1
there 1
and 1
everywhere 1
hung 1
ragged 1
and 1
abandoned 1
cobwebs 1
They 1
presently 1
entered 1
softly 1
with 1
quickened 1
pulses 1
talking 1
in 1
whispers 1
ears 1
alert 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
slightest 1
sound 1
and 1
muscles 1
tense 1
and 1
ready 1
for 1
instant 1
retreat 1
In 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
familiarity 1
modified 1
their 1
fears 1
and 1
they 1
gave 1
the 1
place 1
a 1
critical 1
and 1
interested 1
examination 1
rather 1
admiring 1
their 1
own 1
boldness 1
and 1
wondering 1
at 1
it 1
too 1
Next 1
they 1
wanted 1
to 1
look 1
upstairs 1
This 1
was 1
something 1
like 1
cutting 1
off 1
retreat 1
but 1
they 1
got 1
to 1
daring 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
but 1
one 1
result 1
they 1
threw 1
their 1
tools 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
made 1
the 1
ascent 1
Up 1
there 1
were 1
the 1
same 1
signs 1
of 1
decay 1
In 1
one 1
corner 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
closet 1
that 1
promised 1
mystery 1
but 1
the 1
promise 1
was 1
a 1
fraud 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
Their 1
courage 1
was 1
up 1
now 1
and 1
well 1
in 1
hand 1
They 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
go 1
down 1
and 1
begin 1
work 1
when 1
Sh 1
said 1
Tom 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
whispered 1
Huck 1
blanching 1
with 1
fright 1
Sh 1
There 1
Hear 1
it 1
Yes 1
Oh 1
my 1
Let 1
s 1
run 1
Keep 1
still 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
budge 1
They 1
re 1
coming 1
right 1
toward 1
the 1
door 1
The 1
boys 1
stretched 1
themselves 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
with 1
their 1
eyes 1
to 1
knotholes 1
in 1
the 1
planking 1
and 1
lay 1
waiting 1
in 1
a 1
misery 1
of 1
fear 1
They 1
ve 1
stopped 1
No 1
coming 1
Here 1
they 1
are 1
Don 1
t 1
whisper 1
another 1
word 1
Huck 1
My 1
goodness 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
Two 1
men 1
entered 1
Each 1
boy 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
There 1
s 1
the 1
old 1
deaf 1
and 1
dumb 1
Spaniard 1
that 1
s 1
been 1
about 1
town 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
lately 1
never 1
saw 1
t 1
other 1
man 1
before 1
T 1
other 1
was 1
a 1
ragged 1
unkempt 1
creature 1
with 1
nothing 1
very 1
pleasant 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
The 1
Spaniard 1
was 1
wrapped 1
in 1
a 1
serape 1
he 1
had 1
bushy 1
white 1
whiskers 1
long 1
white 1
hair 1
flowed 1
from 1
under 1
his 1
sombrero 1
and 1
he 1
wore 1
green 1
goggles 1
When 1
they 1
came 1
in 1
t 1
other 1
was 1
talking 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
facing 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
their 1
backs 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
the 1
speaker 1
continued 1
his 1
remarks 1
His 1
manner 1
became 1
less 1
guarded 1
and 1
his 1
words 1
more 1
distinct 1
as 1
he 1
proceeded 1
No 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
ve 1
thought 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
like 1
it 1
It 1
s 1
dangerous 1
Dangerous 1
grunted 1
the 1
deaf 1
and 1
dumb 1
Spaniard 1
to 1
the 1
vast 1
surprise 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
Milksop 1
This 1
voice 1
made 1
the 1
boys 1
gasp 1
and 1
quake 1
It 1
was 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
There 1
was 1
silence 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
Then 1
Joe 1
said 1
What 1
s 1
any 1
more 1
dangerous 1
than 1
that 1
job 1
up 1
yonder 1
but 1
nothing 1
s 1
come 1
of 1
it 1
That 1
s 1
different 1
Away 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
so 1
and 1
not 1
another 1
house 1
about 1
Twon 1
t 1
ever 1
be 1
known 1
that 1
we 1
tried 1
anyway 1
long 1
as 1
we 1
didn 1
t 1
succeed 1
Well 1
what 1
s 1
more 1
dangerous 1
than 1
coming 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
daytime 1
anybody 1
would 1
suspicion 1
us 1
that 1
saw 1
us 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
But 1
there 1
warn 1
t 1
any 1
other 1
place 1
as 1
handy 1
after 1
that 1
fool 1
of 1
a 1
job 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
quit 1
this 1
shanty 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
yesterday 1
only 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
any 1
use 1
trying 1
to 1
stir 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
with 1
those 1
infernal 1
boys 1
playing 1
over 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
hill 1
right 1
in 1
full 1
view 1
Those 1
infernal 1
boys 1
quaked 1
again 1
under 1
the 1
inspiration 1
of 1
this 1
remark 1
and 1
thought 1
how 1
lucky 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
remembered 1
it 1
was 1
Friday 1
and 1
concluded 1
to 1
wait 1
a 1
day 1
They 1
wished 1
in 1
their 1
hearts 1
they 1
had 1
waited 1
a 1
year 1
The 1
two 1
men 1
got 1
out 1
some 1
food 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
luncheon 1
After 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
thoughtful 1
silence 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
said 1
Look 1
here 1
lad 1
you 1
go 1
back 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
where 1
you 1
belong 1
Wait 1
there 1
till 1
you 1
hear 1
from 1
me 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
the 1
chances 1
on 1
dropping 1
into 1
this 1
town 1
just 1
once 1
more 1
for 1
a 1
look 1
We 1
ll 1
do 1
that 1
dangerous 1
job 1
after 1
I 1
ve 1
spied 1
around 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
think 1
things 1
look 1
well 1
for 1
it 1
Then 1
for 1
Texas 1
We 1
ll 1
leg 1
it 1
together 1
This 1
was 1
satisfactory 1
Both 1
men 1
presently 1
fell 1
to 1
yawning 1
and 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
said 1
I 1
m 1
dead 1
for 1
sleep 1
It 1
s 1
your 1
turn 1
to 1
watch 1
He 1
curled 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
weeds 1
and 1
soon 1
began 1
to 1
snore 1
His 1
comrade 1
stirred 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
and 1
he 1
became 1
quiet 1
Presently 1
the 1
watcher 1
began 1
to 1
nod 1
his 1
head 1
drooped 1
lower 1
and 1
lower 1
both 1
men 1
began 1
to 1
snore 1
now 1
The 1
boys 1
drew 1
a 1
long 1
grateful 1
breath 1
Tom 1
whispered 1
Now 1
s 1
our 1
chance 1
come 1
Huck 1
said 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
I 1
d 1
die 1
if 1
they 1
was 1
to 1
wake 1
Tom 1
urged 1
Huck 1
held 1
back 1
At 1
last 1
Tom 1
rose 1
slowly 1
and 1
softly 1
and 1
started 1
alone 1
But 1
the 1
first 1
step 1
he 1
made 1
wrung 1
such 1
a 1
hideous 1
creak 1
from 1
the 1
crazy 1
floor 1
that 1
he 1
sank 1
down 1
almost 1
dead 1
with 1
fright 1
He 1
never 1
made 1
a 1
second 1
attempt 1
The 1
boys 1
lay 1
there 1
counting 1
the 1
dragging 1
moments 1
till 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
time 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
eternity 1
growing 1
gray 1
and 1
then 1
they 1
were 1
grateful 1
to 1
note 1
that 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
setting 1
Now 1
one 1
snore 1
ceased 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
sat 1
up 1
stared 1
around 1
smiled 1
grimly 1
upon 1
his 1
comrade 1
whose 1
head 1
was 1
drooping 1
upon 1
his 1
knees 1
stirred 1
him 1
up 1
with 1
his 1
foot 1
and 1
said 1
Here 1
You 1
re 1
a 1
watchman 1
ain 1
t 1
you 1
All 1
right 1
though 1
nothing 1
s 1
happened 1
My 1
have 1
I 1
been 1
asleep 1
Oh 1
partly 1
partly 1
Nearly 1
time 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
moving 1
pard 1
What 1
ll 1
we 1
do 1
with 1
what 1
little 1
swag 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
left 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
leave 1
it 1
here 1
as 1
we 1
ve 1
always 1
done 1
I 1
reckon 1
No 1
use 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
away 1
till 1
we 1
start 1
south 1
Six 1
hundred 1
and 1
fifty 1
in 1
silver 1
s 1
something 1
to 1
carry 1
Well 1
all 1
right 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
matter 1
to 1
come 1
here 1
once 1
more 1
No 1
but 1
I 1
d 1
say 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
night 1
as 1
we 1
used 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
s 1
better 1
Yes 1
but 1
look 1
here 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
while 1
before 1
I 1
get 1
the 1
right 1
chance 1
at 1
that 1
job 1
accidents 1
might 1
happen 1
tain 1
t 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
place 1
we 1
ll 1
just 1
regularly 1
bury 1
it 1
and 1
bury 1
it 1
deep 1
Good 1
idea 1
said 1
the 1
comrade 1
who 1
walked 1
across 1
the 1
room 1
knelt 1
down 1
raised 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rearward 1
hearth 1
stones 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
bag 1
that 1
jingled 1
pleasantly 1
He 1
subtracted 1
from 1
it 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
dollars 1
for 1
himself 1
and 1
as 1
much 1
for 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
and 1
passed 1
the 1
bag 1
to 1
the 1
latter 1
who 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
now 1
digging 1
with 1
his 1
bowie 1
knife 1
The 1
boys 1
forgot 1
all 1
their 1
fears 1
all 1
their 1
miseries 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
With 1
gloating 1
eyes 1
they 1
watched 1
every 1
movement 1
Luck 1
the 1
splendor 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
beyond 1
all 1
imagination 1
Six 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
was 1
money 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
boys 1
rich 1
Here 1
was 1
treasure 1
hunting 1
under 1
the 1
happiest 1
auspices 1
there 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
any 1
bothersome 1
uncertainty 1
as 1
to 1
where 1
to 1
dig 1
They 1
nudged 1
each 1
other 1
every 1
moment 1
eloquent 1
nudges 1
and 1
easily 1
understood 1
for 1
they 1
simply 1
meant 1
Oh 1
but 1
ain 1
t 1
you 1
glad 1
now 1
we 1
re 1
here 1
Joe 1
s 1
knife 1
struck 1
upon 1
something 1
Hello 1
said 1
he 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
said 1
his 1
comrade 1
Half 1
rotten 1
plank 1
no 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
box 1
I 1
believe 1
Here 1
bear 1
a 1
hand 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
see 1
what 1
it 1
s 1
here 1
for 1
Never 1
mind 1
I 1
ve 1
broke 1
a 1
hole 1
He 1
reached 1
his 1
hand 1
in 1
and 1
drew 1
it 1
out 1
Man 1
it 1
s 1
money 1
The 1
two 1
men 1
examined 1
the 1
handful 1
of 1
coins 1
They 1
were 1
gold 1
The 1
boys 1
above 1
were 1
as 1
excited 1
as 1
themselves 1
and 1
as 1
delighted 1
Joe 1
s 1
comrade 1
said 1
We 1
ll 1
make 1
quick 1
work 1
of 1
this 1
There 1
s 1
an 1
old 1
rusty 1
pick 1
over 1
amongst 1
the 1
weeds 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
fireplace 1
I 1
saw 1
it 1
a 1
minute 1
ago 1
He 1
ran 1
and 1
brought 1
the 1
boys 1
pick 1
and 1
shovel 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
took 1
the 1
pick 1
looked 1
it 1
over 1
critically 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
muttered 1
something 1
to 1
himself 1
and 1
then 1
began 1
to 1
use 1
it 1
The 1
box 1
was 1
soon 1
unearthed 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
very 1
large 1
it 1
was 1
iron 1
bound 1
and 1
had 1
been 1
very 1
strong 1
before 1
the 1
slow 1
years 1
had 1
injured 1
it 1
The 1
men 1
contemplated 1
the 1
treasure 1
awhile 1
in 1
blissful 1
silence 1
Pard 1
there 1
s 1
thousands 1
of 1
dollars 1
here 1
said 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
Twas 1
always 1
said 1
that 1
Murrel 1
s 1
gang 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
around 1
here 1
one 1
summer 1
the 1
stranger 1
observed 1
I 1
know 1
it 1
said 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
and 1
this 1
looks 1
like 1
it 1
I 1
should 1
say 1
Now 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
need 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
job 1
The 1
halfbreed 1
frowned 1
Said 1
he 1
You 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
me 1
Least 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
that 1
thing 1
Tain 1
t 1
robbery 1
altogether 1
it 1
s 1
revenge 1
and 1
a 1
wicked 1
light 1
flamed 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
I 1
ll 1
need 1
your 1
help 1
in 1
it 1
When 1
it 1
s 1
finished 1
then 1
Texas 1
Go 1
home 1
to 1
your 1
Nance 1
and 1
your 1
kids 1
and 1
stand 1
by 1
till 1
you 1
hear 1
from 1
me 1
Well 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
so 1
what 1
ll 1
we 1
do 1
with 1
this 1
bury 1
it 1
again 1
Yes 1
Ravishing 1
delight 1
overhead 1
No 1
by 1
the 1
great 1
Sachem 1
no 1
Profound 1
distress 1
overhead 1
I 1
d 1
nearly 1
forgot 1
That 1
pick 1
had 1
fresh 1
earth 1
on 1
it 1
The 1
boys 1
were 1
sick 1
with 1
terror 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
What 1
business 1
has 1
a 1
pick 1
and 1
a 1
shovel 1
here 1
What 1
business 1
with 1
fresh 1
earth 1
on 1
them 1
Who 1
brought 1
them 1
here 1
and 1
where 1
are 1
they 1
gone 1
Have 1
you 1
heard 1
anybody 1
seen 1
anybody 1
What 1
bury 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
leave 1
them 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
see 1
the 1
ground 1
disturbed 1
Not 1
exactly 1
not 1
exactly 1
We 1
ll 1
take 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
den 1
Why 1
of 1
course 1
Might 1
have 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
before 1
You 1
mean 1
Number 1
One 1
No 1
Number 1
Two 1
under 1
the 1
cross 1
The 1
other 1
place 1
is 1
bad 1
too 1
common 1
All 1
right 1
It 1
s 1
nearly 1
dark 1
enough 1
to 1
start 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
got 1
up 1
and 1
went 1
about 1
from 1
window 1
to 1
window 1
cautiously 1
peeping 1
out 1
Presently 1
he 1
said 1
Who 1
could 1
have 1
brought 1
those 1
tools 1
here 1
Do 1
you 1
reckon 1
they 1
can 1
be 1
upstairs 1
The 1
boys 1
breath 1
forsook 1
them 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
on 1
his 1
knife 1
halted 1
a 1
moment 1
undecided 1
and 1
then 1
turned 1
toward 1
the 1
stairway 1
The 1
boys 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
closet 1
but 1
their 1
strength 1
was 1
gone 1
The 1
steps 1
came 1
creaking 1
up 1
the 1
stairs 1
the 1
intolerable 1
distress 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
woke 1
the 1
stricken 1
resolution 1
of 1
the 1
lads 1
they 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
spring 1
for 1
the 1
closet 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
crash 1
of 1
rotten 1
timbers 1
and 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
landed 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
amid 1
the 1
debris 1
of 1
the 1
ruined 1
stairway 1
He 1
gathered 1
himself 1
up 1
cursing 1
and 1
his 1
comrade 1
said 1
Now 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
If 1
it 1
s 1
anybody 1
and 1
they 1
re 1
up 1
there 1
let 1
them 1
stay 1
there 1
who 1
cares 1
If 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
jump 1
down 1
now 1
and 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
who 1
objects 1
It 1
will 1
be 1
dark 1
in 1
fifteen 1
minutes 1
and 1
then 1
let 1
them 1
follow 1
us 1
if 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
I 1
m 1
willing 1
In 1
my 1
opinion 1
whoever 1
hove 1
those 1
things 1
in 1
here 1
caught 1
a 1
sight 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
took 1
us 1
for 1
ghosts 1
or 1
devils 1
or 1
something 1
I 1
ll 1
bet 1
they 1
re 1
running 1
yet 1
Joe 1
grumbled 1
awhile 1
then 1
he 1
agreed 1
with 1
his 1
friend 1
that 1
what 1
daylight 1
was 1
left 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
economized 1
in 1
getting 1
things 1
ready 1
for 1
leaving 1
Shortly 1
afterward 1
they 1
slipped 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
deepening 1
twilight 1
and 1
moved 1
toward 1
the 1
river 1
with 1
their 1
precious 1
box 1
Tom 1
and 1
Huck 1
rose 1
up 1
weak 1
but 1
vastly 1
relieved 1
and 1
stared 1
after 1
them 1
through 1
the 1
chinks 1
between 1
the 1
logs 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
Follow 1
Not 1
they 1
They 1
were 1
content 1
to 1
reach 1
ground 1
again 1
without 1
broken 1
necks 1
and 1
take 1
the 1
townward 1
track 1
over 1
the 1
hill 1
They 1
did 1
not 1
talk 1
much 1
They 1
were 1
too 1
much 1
absorbed 1
in 1
hating 1
themselves 1
hating 1
the 1
ill 1
luck 1
that 1
made 1
them 1
take 1
the 1
spade 1
and 1
the 1
pick 1
there 1
But 1
for 1
that 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
never 1
would 1
have 1
suspected 1
He 1
would 1
have 1
hidden 1
the 1
silver 1
with 1
the 1
gold 1
to 1
wait 1
there 1
till 1
his 1
revenge 1
was 1
satisfied 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
misfortune 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
money 1
turn 1
up 1
missing 1
Bitter 1
bitter 1
luck 1
that 1
the 1
tools 1
were 1
ever 1
brought 1
there 1
They 1
resolved 1
to 1
keep 1
a 1
lookout 1
for 1
that 1
Spaniard 1
when 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
to 1
town 1
spying 1
out 1
for 1
chances 1
to 1
do 1
his 1
revengeful 1
job 1
and 1
follow 1
him 1
to 1
Number 1
Two 1
wherever 1
that 1
might 1
be 1
Then 1
a 1
ghastly 1
thought 1
occurred 1
to 1
Tom 1
Revenge 1
What 1
if 1
he 1
means 1
us 1
Huck 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
said 1
Huck 1
nearly 1
fainting 1
They 1
talked 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
as 1
they 1
entered 1
town 1
they 1
agreed 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
possibly 1
mean 1
somebody 1
else 1
at 1
least 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
at 1
least 1
mean 1
nobody 1
but 1
Tom 1
since 1
only 1
Tom 1
had 1
testified 1
Very 1
very 1
small 1
comfort 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
Tom 1
to 1
be 1
alone 1
in 1
danger 1
Company 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
palpable 1
improvement 1
he 1
thought 1
CHAPTER 1
XXVII 1
THE 1
adventure 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
mightily 1
tormented 1
Tom 1
s 1
dreams 1
that 1
night 1
Four 1
times 1
he 1
had 1
his 1
hands 1
on 1
that 1
rich 1
treasure 1
and 1
four 1
times 1
it 1
wasted 1
to 1
nothingness 1
in 1
his 1
fingers 1
as 1
sleep 1
forsook 1
him 1
and 1
wakefulness 1
brought 1
back 1
the 1
hard 1
reality 1
of 1
his 1
misfortune 1
As 1
he 1
lay 1
in 1
the 1
early 1
morning 1
recalling 1
the 1
incidents 1
of 1
his 1
great 1
adventure 1
he 1
noticed 1
that 1
they 1
seemed 1
curiously 1
subdued 1
and 1
far 1
away 1
somewhat 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
happened 1
in 1
another 1
world 1
or 1
in 1
a 1
time 1
long 1
gone 1
by 1
Then 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
great 1
adventure 1
itself 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
dream 1
There 1
was 1
one 1
very 1
strong 1
argument 1
in 1
favor 1
of 1
this 1
idea 1
namely 1
that 1
the 1
quantity 1
of 1
coin 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
was 1
too 1
vast 1
to 1
be 1
real 1
He 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
fifty 1
dollars 1
in 1
one 1
mass 1
before 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
like 1
all 1
boys 1
of 1
his 1
age 1
and 1
station 1
in 1
life 1
in 1
that 1
he 1
imagined 1
that 1
all 1
references 1
to 1
hundreds 1
and 1
thousands 1
were 1
mere 1
fanciful 1
forms 1
of 1
speech 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
such 1
sums 1
really 1
existed 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
He 1
never 1
had 1
supposed 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
that 1
so 1
large 1
a 1
sum 1
as 1
a 1
hundred 1
dollars 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
in 1
actual 1
money 1
in 1
any 1
one 1
s 1
possession 1
If 1
his 1
notions 1
of 1
hidden 1
treasure 1
had 1
been 1
analyzed 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
found 1
to 1
consist 1
of 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
real 1
dimes 1
and 1
a 1
bushel 1
of 1
vague 1
splendid 1
ungraspable 1
dollars 1
But 1
the 1
incidents 1
of 1
his 1
adventure 1
grew 1
sensibly 1
sharper 1
and 1
clearer 1
under 1
the 1
attrition 1
of 1
thinking 1
them 1
over 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
presently 1
found 1
himself 1
leaning 1
to 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
dream 1
after 1
all 1
This 1
uncertainty 1
must 1
be 1
swept 1
away 1
He 1
would 1
snatch 1
a 1
hurried 1
breakfast 1
and 1
go 1
and 1
find 1
Huck 1
Huck 1
was 1
sitting 1
on 1
the 1
gunwale 1
of 1
a 1
flatboat 1
listlessly 1
dangling 1
his 1
feet 1
in 1
the 1
water 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
melancholy 1
Tom 1
concluded 1
to 1
let 1
Huck 1
lead 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
subject 1
If 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
then 1
the 1
adventure 1
would 1
be 1
proved 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
only 1
a 1
dream 1
Hello 1
Huck 1
Hello 1
yourself 1
Silence 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
Tom 1
if 1
we 1
d 1
a 1
left 1
the 1
blame 1
tools 1

the 1
dead 1
tree 1

Oh 1

A 1

chance 1

a 1
pile 1

I 1
d 1
feel 1
mighty 1
shaky 1
if 1
I 1

Well 1
so 1
d 1
I 1
but 1
I 1
d 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
anyway 1
and 1
track 1

Number 1

But 1

What 1

It 1
s 1
too 1
deep 1
Say 1
Huck 1
maybe 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
Goody 1
No 1

town 1
They 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
numbers 1
here 1
Well 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
Lemme 1
think 1
a 1
minute 1
Here 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
a 1
room 1
in 1
a 1
tavern 1
you 1
know 1
Oh 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
trick 1
They 1
ain 1
t 1
only 1
two 1
taverns 1
We 1
can 1
find 1
out 1
quick 1
You 1
stay 1
here 1
Huck 1
till 1
I 1
come 1
Tom 1
was 1
off 1
at 1
once 1
He 1
did 1
not 1
care 1
to 1
have 1
Huck 1
s 1
company 1
in 1
public 1
places 1
He 1
was 1
gone 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
He 1
found 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
tavern 1
No 1
had 1
long 1
been 1
occupied 1
by 1
a 1
young 1
lawyer 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
so 1
occupied 1
In 1
the 1
less 1
ostentatious 1
house 1
No 1
was 1
a 1
mystery 1
The 1
tavern 1
keeper 1
s 1
young 1
son 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
kept 1
locked 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
he 1
never 1
saw 1
anybody 1
go 1
into 1
it 1
or 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
except 1
at 1
night 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
any 1
particular 1
reason 1
for 1
this 1
state 1
of 1
things 1
had 1
had 1
some 1
little 1
curiosity 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
rather 1
feeble 1
had 1
made 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
the 1
mystery 1
by 1
entertaining 1
himself 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
that 1
room 1
was 1
ha 1
nted 1
had 1
noticed 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
there 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
That 1
s 1
what 1
I 1
ve 1
found 1
out 1
Huck 1
I 1
reckon 1
that 1
s 1
the 1
very 1
No 1
we 1
re 1
after 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
is 1
Tom 1
Now 1
what 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
do 1
Lemme 1
think 1
Tom 1
thought 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
The 1
back 1
door 1
of 1
that 1
No 1
is 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
comes 1
out 1
into 1
that 1
little 1
close 1
alley 1
between 1
the 1
tavern 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
rattle 1
trap 1
of 1
a 1
brick 1
store 1
Now 1
you 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
doorkeys 1
you 1
can 1
find 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
nip 1
all 1
of 1
auntie 1
s 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
dark 1
night 1
we 1
ll 1
go 1
there 1
and 1
try 1
em 1
And 1
mind 1
you 1
keep 1
a 1
lookout 1
for 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
because 1
he 1
said 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
drop 1
into 1
town 1
and 1
spy 1
around 1
once 1
more 1
for 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
revenge 1
If 1
you 1
see 1
him 1
you 1
just 1
follow 1
him 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
don 1
t 1

No 1

Well 1

night 1
Tom 1
and 1
Huck 1
were 1
ready 1
for 1
their 1
adventure 1
They 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
neighborhood 1
of 1
the 1
tavern 1
until 1
after 1
nine 1
one 1
watching 1
the 1
alley 1
at 1
a 1
distance 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
the 1
tavern 1
door 1
Nobody 1
entered 1
the 1
alley 1
or 1
left 1
it 1
nobody 1
resembling 1
the 1
Spaniard 1
entered 1
or 1
left 1
the 1
tavern 1
door 1
The 1
night 1
promised 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
fair 1
one 1
so 1
Tom 1
went 1
home 1
with 1
the 1
understanding 1
that 1
if 1
a 1
considerable 1
degree 1
of 1
darkness 1
came 1
on 1
Huck 1
was 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
maow 1
whereupon 1
he 1
would 1
slip 1
out 1
and 1
try 1
the 1
keys 1
But 1
the 1
night 1
remained 1
clear 1
and 1
Huck 1
closed 1
his 1
watch 1
and 1
retired 1
to 1
bed 1
in 1
an 1
empty 1
sugar 1
hogshead 1
about 1
twelve 1
Tuesday 1
the 1
boys 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
ill 1
luck 1
Also 1
Wednesday 1
But 1
Thursday 1
night 1
promised 1
better 1
Tom 1
slipped 1
out 1
in 1
good 1
season 1
with 1
his 1
aunt 1
s 1
old 1
tin 1
lantern 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
towel 1
to 1
blindfold 1
it 1
with 1
He 1
hid 1
the 1
lantern 1
in 1
Huck 1
s 1
sugar 1
hogshead 1
and 1
the 1
watch 1
began 1
An 1
hour 1
before 1
midnight 1
the 1
tavern 1
closed 1
up 1
and 1
its 1
lights 1
the 1
only 1
ones 1
thereabouts 1
were 1
put 1
out 1
No 1
Spaniard 1
had 1
been 1
seen 1
Nobody 1
had 1
entered 1
or 1
left 1
the 1
alley 1
Everything 1
was 1
auspicious 1
The 1
blackness 1
of 1
darkness 1
reigned 1
the 1
perfect 1
stillness 1
was 1
interrupted 1
only 1
by 1
occasional 1
mutterings 1
of 1
distant 1
thunder 1
Tom 1
got 1
his 1
lantern 1
lit 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
hogshead 1
wrapped 1
it 1
closely 1
in 1
the 1
towel 1
and 1
the 1
two 1
adventurers 1
crept 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
toward 1
the 1
tavern 1
Huck 1
stood 1
sentry 1
and 1
Tom 1
felt 1
his 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
alley 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
season 1
of 1
waiting 1
anxiety 1
that 1
weighed 1
upon 1
Huck 1
s 1
spirits 1
like 1
a 1
mountain 1
He 1
began 1
to 1
wish 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
flash 1
from 1
the 1
lantern 1
it 1
would 1
frighten 1
him 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
at 1
least 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
Tom 1
was 1
alive 1
yet 1
It 1
seemed 1
hours 1
since 1
Tom 1
had 1
disappeared 1
Surely 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
fainted 1
maybe 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
maybe 1
his 1
heart 1
had 1
burst 1
under 1
terror 1
and 1
excitement 1
In 1
his 1
uneasiness 1
Huck 1
found 1
himself 1
drawing 1
closer 1
and 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
alley 1
fearing 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
dreadful 1
things 1
and 1
momentarily 1
expecting 1
some 1
catastrophe 1
to 1
happen 1
that 1
would 1
take 1
away 1
his 1
breath 1
There 1
was 1
not 1
much 1
to 1
take 1
away 1
for 1
he 1
seemed 1
only 1
able 1
to 1
inhale 1
it 1
by 1
thimblefuls 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
would 1
soon 1
wear 1
itself 1
out 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
beating 1
Suddenly 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
flash 1
of 1
light 1
and 1
Tom 1
came 1
tearing 1
by 1
him 1
Run 1
said 1
he 1
run 1
for 1
your 1
life 1
He 1
needn 1
t 1
have 1
repeated 1
it 1
once 1
was 1
enough 1
Huck 1
was 1
making 1
thirty 1
or 1
forty 1
miles 1
an 1
hour 1
before 1
the 1
repetition 1
was 1
uttered 1
The 1
boys 1
never 1
stopped 1
till 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
shed 1
of 1
a 1
deserted 1
slaughter 1
house 1
at 1
the 1
lower 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
Just 1
as 1
they 1
got 1
within 1
its 1
shelter 1
the 1
storm 1
burst 1
and 1
the 1
rain 1
poured 1
down 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
Tom 1
got 1
his 1
breath 1
he 1
said 1
Huck 1
it 1
was 1
awful 1
I 1
tried 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
keys 1
just 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
but 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
make 1
such 1
a 1
power 1
of 1
racket 1
that 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
hardly 1
get 1
my 1
breath 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
scared 1
They 1
wouldn 1
t 1
turn 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
either 1
Well 1
without 1
noticing 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
doing 1
I 1
took 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
knob 1
and 1
open 1
comes 1
the 1
door 1
It 1
warn 1
t 1
locked 1
I 1
hopped 1
in 1
and 1
shook 1
off 1
the 1
towel 1
and 1
Great 1
Caesar 1
s 1
Ghost 1
What 1
what 1
d 1
you 1
see 1
Tom 1
Huck 1
I 1
most 1
stepped 1
onto 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
hand 1
No 1
Yes 1
He 1
was 1
lying 1
there 1
sound 1
asleep 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
with 1
his 1
old 1
patch 1
on 1
his 1
eye 1
and 1
his 1
arms 1
spread 1
out 1
Lordy 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
Did 1
he 1
wake 1
up 1
No 1
never 1
budged 1
Drunk 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
just 1
grabbed 1
that 1
towel 1
and 1
started 1
I 1
d 1
never 1
a 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
towel 1
I 1
bet 1
Well 1
I 1
would 1
My 1
aunt 1
would 1
make 1
me 1
mighty 1
sick 1
if 1
I 1
lost 1
it 1
Say 1
Tom 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
box 1
Huck 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
wait 1
to 1
look 1
around 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
the 1
box 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
the 1
cross 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
see 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
bottle 1
and 1
a 1
tin 1
cup 1
on 1
the 1
floor 1
by 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
yes 1
I 1
saw 1
two 1
barrels 1
and 1
lots 1
more 1
bottles 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
Don 1

you 1
see 1
now 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1

that 1
ha 1
nted 1
room 1
How 1
Why 1

whiskey 1
Maybe 1

the 1
Temperance 1
Taverns 1
have 1
got 1
a 1
ha 1
nted 1
room 1
hey 1
Huck 1
Well 1
I 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
Who 1
d 1
a 1
thought 1
such 1
a 1
thing 1
But 1
say 1
Tom 1
now 1
s 1
a 1
mighty 1
good 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
that 1
box 1
if 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
drunk 1
It 1
is 1
that 1
You 1
try 1
it 1
Huck 1
shuddered 1
Well 1
no 1
I 1
reckon 1
not 1
And 1
I 1
reckon 1
not 1
Huck 1
Only 1
one 1
bottle 1
alongside 1
of 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
ain 1
t 1
enough 1
If 1
there 1
d 1
been 1
three 1
he 1
d 1
be 1
drunk 1
enough 1
and 1
I 1
d 1
do 1
it 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
pause 1
for 1
reflection 1
and 1
then 1
Tom 1
said 1
Lookyhere 1
Huck 1

not 1
try 1
that 1
thing 1
any 1
more 1
till 1
we 1
know 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
not 1
in 1
there 1
It 1
s 1
too 1
scary 1
Now 1

CHAPTER 1
XXIX 1
THE 1
first 1
thing 1
Tom 1
heard 1
on 1
Friday 1
morning 1
was 1
a 1
glad 1
piece 1
of 1
news 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
s 1
family 1
had 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
town 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
Both 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
and 1
the 1
treasure 1
sunk 1
into 1
secondary 1
importance 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
Becky 1
took 1
the 1
chief 1
place 1
in 1
the 1
boy 1
s 1
interest 1
He 1
saw 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
an 1
exhausting 1
good 1
time 1
playing 1
hispy 1
and 1
gully 1
keeper 1
with 1
a 1
crowd 1
of 1
their 1
schoolmates 1
The 1
day 1
was 1
completed 1
and 1
crowned 1
in 1
a 1
peculiarly 1
satisfactory 1
way 1
Becky 1
teased 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
appoint 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
long 1
promised 1
and 1
long 1
delayed 1
picnic 1
and 1
she 1
consented 1
The 1
child 1
s 1
delight 1
was 1
boundless 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
not 1
more 1
moderate 1
The 1
invitations 1
were 1
sent 1
out 1
before 1
sunset 1
and 1
straightway 1
the 1
young 1
folks 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
were 1
thrown 1
into 1
a 1
fever 1
of 1
preparation 1
and 1
pleasurable 1
anticipation 1
Tom 1
s 1
excitement 1
enabled 1
him 1
to 1
keep 1
awake 1
until 1
a 1
pretty 1
late 1
hour 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
good 1
hopes 1
of 1
hearing 1
Huck 1
s 1
maow 1
and 1
of 1
having 1
his 1
treasure 1
to 1
astonish 1
Becky 1
and 1
the 1
picnickers 1
with 1
next 1
day 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
disappointed 1
No 1
signal 1
came 1
that 1
night 1
Morning 1
came 1
eventually 1
and 1
by 1
ten 1
or 1
eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
a 1
giddy 1
and 1
rollicking 1
company 1
were 1
gathered 1
at 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
s 1
and 1
everything 1
was 1
ready 1
for 1
a 1
start 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
custom 1
for 1
elderly 1
people 1
to 1
mar 1
the 1
picnics 1
with 1
their 1
presence 1
The 1
children 1
were 1
considered 1
safe 1
enough 1
under 1
the 1
wings 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
young 1
ladies 1
of 1
eighteen 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
young 1
gentlemen 1
of 1
twenty 1
three 1
or 1
thereabouts 1
The 1
old 1
steam 1
ferry 1
boat 1
was 1
chartered 1
for 1
the 1
occasion 1
presently 1
the 1
gay 1
throng 1
filed 1
up 1
the 1
main 1
street 1
laden 1
with 1
provision 1
baskets 1
Sid 1
was 1
sick 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
miss 1
the 1
fun 1
Mary 1
remained 1
at 1
home 1
to 1
entertain 1
him 1
The 1
last 1
thing 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
said 1
to 1
Becky 1
was 1
You 1
ll 1
not 1
get 1
back 1
till 1
late 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
d 1
better 1
stay 1
all 1
night 1
with 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
girls 1
that 1
live 1
near 1
the 1
ferry 1
landing 1
child 1
Then 1
I 1
ll 1
stay 1
with 1
Susy 1
Harper 1
mamma 1
Very 1
well 1
And 1
mind 1
and 1
behave 1
yourself 1
and 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
any 1
trouble 1
Presently 1
as 1
they 1
tripped 1
along 1
Tom 1
said 1
to 1
Becky 1
Say 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
we 1
ll 1
do 1
Stead 1
of 1
going 1
to 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
s 1
we 1
ll 1
climb 1
right 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
and 1
stop 1
at 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
She 1
ll 1
have 1
ice 1
cream 1
She 1
has 1
it 1
most 1
every 1
day 1
dead 1
loads 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
she 1
ll 1
be 1
awful 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
us 1
Oh 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
fun 1
Then 1
Becky 1
reflected 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
said 1
But 1
what 1
will 1
mamma 1
say 1
How 1
ll 1
she 1
ever 1
know 1
The 1
girl 1
turned 1
the 1
idea 1
over 1
in 1
her 1
mind 1
and 1
said 1
reluctantly 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
s 1
wrong 1
but 1
But 1
shucks 1
Your 1
mother 1
won 1
t 1
know 1
and 1
so 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
harm 1
All 1
she 1
wants 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
ll 1
be 1
safe 1
and 1
I 1
bet 1
you 1

The 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
splendid 1
hospitality 1
was 1
a 1
tempting 1
bait 1
It 1
and 1
Tom 1
s 1
persuasions 1
presently 1
carried 1
the 1
day 1
So 1
it 1
was 1
decided 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
to 1
anybody 1
about 1
the 1
night 1
s 1
programme 1
Presently 1
it 1
occurred 1
to 1
Tom 1
that 1
maybe 1
Huck 1
might 1
come 1
this 1
very 1
night 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
signal 1
The 1
thought 1
took 1
a 1
deal 1
of 1
the 1
spirit 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
anticipations 1
Still 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
give 1
up 1
the 1
fun 1
at 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
And 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
he 1
reasoned 1
the 1
signal 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
so 1
why 1
should 1
it 1
be 1
any 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
come 1
tonight 1
The 1
sure 1
fun 1
of 1
the 1
evening 1
outweighed 1
the 1
uncertain 1
treasure 1
and 1
boy 1
like 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
the 1
stronger 1
inclination 1
and 1
not 1
allow 1
himself 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
box 1
of 1
money 1
another 1
time 1
that 1
day 1
Three 1
miles 1
below 1
town 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
stopped 1
at 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
a 1
woody 1
hollow 1
and 1
tied 1
up 1
The 1
crowd 1
swarmed 1
ashore 1
and 1
soon 1
the 1
forest 1
distances 1
and 1
craggy 1
heights 1
echoed 1
far 1
and 1
near 1
with 1
shoutings 1
and 1
laughter 1
All 1
the 1
different 1
ways 1
of 1
getting 1
hot 1
and 1
tired 1
were 1
gone 1
through 1
with 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
rovers 1
straggled 1
back 1
to 1
camp 1
fortified 1
with 1
responsible 1
appetites 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
good 1
things 1
began 1
After 1
the 1
feast 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
refreshing 1
season 1
of 1
rest 1
and 1
chat 1
in 1
the 1
shade 1
of 1
spreading 1
oaks 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
somebody 1
shouted 1
Who 1
s 1
ready 1
for 1
the 1
cave 1
Everybody 1
was 1
Bundles 1
of 1
candles 1
were 1
procured 1
and 1
straightway 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
general 1
scamper 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
The 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
was 1
up 1
the 1
hillside 1
an 1
opening 1
shaped 1
like 1
a 1
letter 1
A 1
Its 1
massive 1
oaken 1
door 1
stood 1
unbarred 1
Within 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
chamber 1
chilly 1
as 1
an 1
icehouse 1
and 1
walled 1
by 1
Nature 1
with 1
solid 1
limestone 1
that 1
was 1
dewy 1
with 1
a 1
cold 1
sweat 1
It 1
was 1
romantic 1
and 1
mysterious 1
to 1
stand 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
deep 1
gloom 1
and 1
look 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
green 1
valley 1
shining 1
in 1
the 1
sun 1
But 1
the 1
impressiveness 1
of 1
the 1
situation 1
quickly 1
wore 1
off 1
and 1
the 1
romping 1
began 1
again 1
The 1
moment 1
a 1
candle 1
was 1
lighted 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
general 1
rush 1
upon 1
the 1
owner 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
struggle 1
and 1
a 1
gallant 1
defence 1
followed 1
but 1
the 1
candle 1
was 1
soon 1
knocked 1
down 1
or 1
blown 1
out 1
and 1
then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
glad 1
clamor 1
of 1
laughter 1
and 1
a 1
new 1
chase 1
But 1
all 1
things 1
have 1
an 1
end 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
procession 1
went 1
filing 1
down 1
the 1
steep 1
descent 1
of 1
the 1
main 1
avenue 1
the 1
flickering 1
rank 1
of 1
lights 1
dimly 1
revealing 1
the 1
lofty 1
walls 1
of 1
rock 1
almost 1
to 1
their 1
point 1
of 1
junction 1
sixty 1
feet 1
overhead 1
This 1
main 1
avenue 1
was 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
eight 1
or 1
ten 1
feet 1
wide 1
Every 1
few 1
steps 1
other 1
lofty 1
and 1
still 1
narrower 1
crevices 1
branched 1
from 1
it 1
on 1
either 1
hand 1
for 1
McDougal 1
s 1
cave 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
vast 1
labyrinth 1
of 1
crooked 1
aisles 1
that 1
ran 1
into 1
each 1
other 1
and 1
out 1
again 1
and 1
led 1
nowhere 1
It 1
was 1
said 1
that 1
one 1
might 1
wander 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
together 1
through 1
its 1
intricate 1
tangle 1
of 1
rifts 1
and 1
chasms 1
and 1
never 1
find 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
go 1
down 1
and 1
down 1
and 1
still 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
earth 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
labyrinth 1
under 1
labyrinth 1
and 1
no 1
end 1
to 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
No 1
man 1
knew 1
the 1
cave 1
That 1
was 1
an 1
impossible 1
thing 1
Most 1
of 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
knew 1
a 1
portion 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
customary 1
to 1
venture 1
much 1
beyond 1
this 1
known 1
portion 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
knew 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
as 1
any 1
one 1
The 1
procession 1
moved 1
along 1
the 1
main 1
avenue 1
some 1
three 1
quarters 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
and 1
then 1
groups 1
and 1
couples 1
began 1
to 1
slip 1
aside 1
into 1
branch 1
avenues 1
fly 1
along 1
the 1
dismal 1
corridors 1
and 1
take 1
each 1
other 1
by 1
surprise 1
at 1
points 1
where 1
the 1
corridors 1
joined 1
again 1
Parties 1
were 1
able 1
to 1
elude 1
each 1
other 1
for 1
the 1
space 1
of 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
without 1
going 1
beyond 1
the 1
known 1
ground 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
one 1
group 1
after 1
another 1
came 1
straggling 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
panting 1
hilarious 1
smeared 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
with 1
tallow 1
drippings 1
daubed 1
with 1
clay 1
and 1
entirely 1
delighted 1
with 1
the 1
success 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
Then 1
they 1
were 1
astonished 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
taking 1
no 1
note 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
that 1
night 1
was 1
about 1
at 1
hand 1
The 1
clanging 1
bell 1
had 1
been 1
calling 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
However 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
day 1
s 1
adventures 1
was 1
romantic 1
and 1
therefore 1
satisfactory 1
When 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
with 1
her 1
wild 1
freight 1
pushed 1
into 1
the 1
stream 1
nobody 1
cared 1
sixpence 1
for 1
the 1
wasted 1
time 1
but 1
the 1
captain 1
of 1
the 1
craft 1
Huck 1
was 1
already 1
upon 1
his 1
watch 1
when 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
s 1
lights 1
went 1
glinting 1
past 1
the 1
wharf 1
He 1
heard 1
no 1
noise 1
on 1
board 1
for 1
the 1
young 1
people 1
were 1
as 1
subdued 1
and 1
still 1
as 1
people 1
usually 1
are 1
who 1
are 1
nearly 1
tired 1
to 1
death 1
He 1
wondered 1
what 1
boat 1
it 1
was 1
and 1
why 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
stop 1
at 1
the 1
wharf 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
dropped 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mind 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
attention 1
upon 1
his 1
business 1
The 1
night 1
was 1
growing 1
cloudy 1
and 1
dark 1
Ten 1
o 1
clock 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
noise 1
of 1
vehicles 1
ceased 1
scattered 1
lights 1
began 1
to 1
wink 1
out 1
all 1
straggling 1
foot 1
passengers 1
disappeared 1
the 1
village 1
betook 1
itself 1
to 1
its 1
slumbers 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
small 1
watcher 1
alone 1
with 1
the 1
silence 1
and 1
the 1
ghosts 1
Eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
tavern 1
lights 1
were 1
put 1
out 1
darkness 1
everywhere 1
now 1
Huck 1
waited 1
what 1
seemed 1
a 1
weary 1
long 1
time 1
but 1
nothing 1
happened 1
His 1
faith 1
was 1
weakening 1
Was 1
there 1
any 1
use 1
Was 1
there 1
really 1
any 1
use 1
Why 1
not 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
turn 1
in 1
A 1
noise 1
fell 1
upon 1
his 1
ear 1
He 1
was 1
all 1
attention 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
The 1
alley 1
door 1
closed 1
softly 1
He 1
sprang 1
to 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
brick 1
store 1
The 1
next 1
moment 1
two 1
men 1
brushed 1
by 1
him 1
and 1
one 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
under 1
his 1
arm 1
It 1
must 1
be 1
that 1
box 1
So 1
they 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
treasure 1
Why 1
call 1
Tom 1
now 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
absurd 1
the 1
men 1
would 1
get 1
away 1
with 1
the 1
box 1
and 1
never 1
be 1
found 1
again 1
No 1
he 1
would 1
stick 1
to 1
their 1
wake 1
and 1
follow 1
them 1
he 1
would 1
trust 1
to 1
the 1
darkness 1
for 1
security 1
from 1
discovery 1
So 1
communing 1
with 1
himself 1
Huck 1
stepped 1
out 1
and 1
glided 1
along 1
behind 1
the 1
men 1
cat 1
like 1
with 1
bare 1
feet 1
allowing 1
them 1
to 1
keep 1
just 1
far 1
enough 1
ahead 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
invisible 1
They 1
moved 1
up 1
the 1
river 1
street 1
three 1
blocks 1
then 1
turned 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
up 1
a 1
crossstreet 1
They 1
went 1
straight 1
ahead 1
then 1
until 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
path 1
that 1
led 1
up 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
this 1
they 1
took 1
They 1
passed 1
by 1
the 1
old 1
Welshman 1
s 1
house 1
halfway 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
without 1
hesitating 1
and 1
still 1
climbed 1
upward 1
Good 1
thought 1
Huck 1
they 1
will 1
bury 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
quarry 1
But 1
they 1
never 1
stopped 1
at 1
the 1
quarry 1
They 1
passed 1
on 1
up 1
the 1
summit 1
They 1
plunged 1
into 1
the 1
narrow 1
path 1
between 1
the 1
tall 1
sumach 1
bushes 1
and 1
were 1
at 1
once 1
hidden 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
Huck 1
closed 1
up 1
and 1
shortened 1
his 1
distance 1
now 1
for 1
they 1
would 1
never 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
He 1
trotted 1
along 1
awhile 1
then 1
slackened 1
his 1
pace 1
fearing 1
he 1
was 1
gaining 1
too 1
fast 1
moved 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
then 1
stopped 1
altogether 1
listened 1
no 1
sound 1
none 1
save 1
that 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
beating 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
heart 1
The 1
hooting 1
of 1
an 1
owl 1
came 1
over 1
the 1
hill 1
ominous 1
sound 1
But 1
no 1
footsteps 1
Heavens 1
was 1
everything 1
lost 1
He 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
spring 1
with 1
winged 1
feet 1
when 1
a 1
man 1
cleared 1
his 1
throat 1
not 1
four 1
feet 1
from 1
him 1
Huck 1
s 1
heart 1
shot 1
into 1
his 1
throat 1
but 1
he 1
swallowed 1
it 1
again 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
shaking 1
as 1
if 1
a 1
dozen 1
agues 1
had 1
taken 1
charge 1
of 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
so 1
weak 1
that 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
must 1
surely 1
fall 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
He 1
knew 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
He 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
within 1
five 1
steps 1
of 1
the 1
stile 1
leading 1
into 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
grounds 1
Very 1
well 1
he 1
thought 1
let 1
them 1
bury 1
it 1
there 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
hard 1
to 1
find 1
Now 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
voice 1
a 1
very 1
low 1
voice 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
Damn 1
her 1
maybe 1
she 1
s 1
got 1
company 1
there 1
s 1
lights 1
late 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
see 1
any 1
This 1
was 1
that 1
stranger 1
s 1
voice 1
the 1
stranger 1
of 1
the 1
haunted 1
house 1
A 1
deadly 1
chill 1
went 1
to 1
Huck 1
s 1
heart 1
this 1
then 1
was 1
the 1
revenge 1
job 1
His 1
thought 1
was 1
to 1
fly 1
Then 1
he 1
remembered 1
that 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
had 1
been 1
kind 1
to 1
him 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
and 1
maybe 1
these 1
men 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
murder 1
her 1
He 1
wished 1
he 1
dared 1
venture 1
to 1
warn 1
her 1
but 1
he 1
knew 1
he 1
didn 1
t 1
dare 1
they 1
might 1
come 1
and 1
catch 1
him 1
He 1
thought 1
all 1
this 1
and 1
more 1
in 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
elapsed 1
between 1
the 1
stranger 1
s 1
remark 1
and 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
next 1
which 1
was 1
Because 1
the 1
bush 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
way 1
Now 1
this 1
way 1
now 1
you 1
see 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
Yes 1
Well 1
there 1
is 1
company 1
there 1
I 1
reckon 1
Better 1
give 1
it 1
up 1
Give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
I 1
just 1
leaving 1
this 1
country 1
forever 1
Give 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
maybe 1
never 1
have 1
another 1
chance 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
again 1
as 1
I 1
ve 1
told 1
you 1
before 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
care 1
for 1
her 1
swag 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
it 1
But 1
her 1
husband 1
was 1
rough 1
on 1
me 1
many 1
times 1
he 1
was 1
rough 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
mainly 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
justice 1
of 1
the 1
peace 1
that 1
jugged 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
vagrant 1
And 1
that 1
ain 1
t 1
all 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
millionth 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
He 1
had 1
me 1
horsewhipped 1
horsewhipped 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
jail 1
like 1
a 1
nigger 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
town 1
looking 1
on 1
Horsewhipped 1
do 1
you 1
understand 1
He 1
took 1
advantage 1
of 1
me 1
and 1
died 1
But 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
kill 1
her 1
Don 1
t 1
do 1
that 1
Kill 1
Who 1
said 1
anything 1
about 1
killing 1
I 1
would 1
kill 1
him 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
here 1
but 1
not 1
her 1
When 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
revenge 1
on 1
a 1
woman 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
kill 1
her 1
bosh 1
you 1
go 1
for 1
her 1
looks 1
You 1
slit 1
her 1
nostrils 1
you 1
notch 1
her 1
ears 1
like 1
a 1
sow 1
By 1
God 1
that 1
s 1
Keep 1
your 1
opinion 1
to 1
yourself 1
It 1
will 1
be 1
safest 1
for 1
you 1
I 1
ll 1
tie 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
bed 1
If 1
she 1
bleeds 1
to 1
death 1
is 1
that 1
my 1
fault 1
I 1
ll 1
not 1
cry 1
if 1
she 1
does 1
My 1
friend 1
you 1
ll 1
help 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
thing 1
for 1
my 1
sake 1
that 1
s 1
why 1
you 1
re 1
here 1
I 1
mightn 1
t 1
be 1
able 1
alone 1
If 1
you 1
flinch 1
I 1
ll 1
kill 1
you 1
Do 1
you 1
understand 1
that 1
And 1
if 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
kill 1
you 1
I 1
ll 1
kill 1
her 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
reckon 1
nobody 1
ll 1
ever 1
know 1
much 1
about 1
who 1
done 1
this 1
business 1
Well 1
if 1
it 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
let 1
s 1
get 1
at 1
it 1
The 1
quicker 1
the 1
better 1
I 1
m 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
shiver 1
Do 1
it 1
now 1
And 1
company 1
there 1
Look 1
here 1
I 1
ll 1
get 1
suspicious 1
of 1
you 1
first 1
thing 1
you 1
know 1
No 1
we 1
ll 1
wait 1
till 1
the 1
lights 1
are 1
out 1
there 1
s 1
no 1
hurry 1
Huck 1
felt 1
that 1
a 1
silence 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
ensue 1
a 1
thing 1
still 1
more 1
awful 1
than 1
any 1
amount 1
of 1
murderous 1
talk 1
so 1
he 1
held 1
his 1
breath 1
and 1
stepped 1
gingerly 1
back 1
planted 1
his 1
foot 1
carefully 1
and 1
firmly 1
after 1
balancing 1
one 1
legged 1
in 1
a 1
precarious 1
way 1
and 1
almost 1
toppling 1
over 1
first 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
then 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
He 1
took 1
another 1
step 1
back 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
elaboration 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
risks 1
then 1
another 1
and 1
another 1
and 1
a 1
twig 1
snapped 1
under 1
his 1
foot 1
His 1
breath 1
stopped 1
and 1
he 1
listened 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
sound 1
the 1
stillness 1
was 1
perfect 1
His 1
gratitude 1
was 1
measureless 1
Now 1
he 1
turned 1
in 1
his 1
tracks 1
between 1
the 1
walls 1
of 1
sumach 1
bushes 1
turned 1
himself 1
as 1
carefully 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
a 1
ship 1
and 1
then 1
stepped 1
quickly 1
but 1
cautiously 1
along 1
When 1
he 1
emerged 1
at 1
the 1
quarry 1
he 1
felt 1
secure 1
and 1
so 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
his 1
nimble 1
heels 1
and 1
flew 1
Down 1
down 1
he 1
sped 1
till 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
Welshman 1
s 1
He 1
banged 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
presently 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
two 1
stalwart 1
sons 1
were 1
thrust 1
from 1
windows 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
row 1
there 1
Who 1
s 1
banging 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
Let 1
me 1
in 1
quick 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
everything 1
Why 1
who 1
are 1
you 1
Huckleberry 1
Finn 1
quick 1
let 1
me 1
in 1
Huckleberry 1
Finn 1
indeed 1
It 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
name 1
to 1
open 1
many 1
doors 1
I 1
judge 1
But 1
let 1
him 1
in 1
lads 1
and 1
let 1
s 1
see 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
trouble 1
Please 1
don 1
t 1
ever 1
tell 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
were 1
Huck 1
s 1
first 1
words 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
in 1
Please 1
don 1
t 1
I 1
d 1
be 1
killed 1
sure 1
but 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
been 1
good 1
friends 1
to 1
me 1
sometimes 1
and 1
I 1
want 1
to 1
tell 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
if 1
you 1
ll 1
promise 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
ever 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
me 1
By 1
George 1
he 1
has 1
got 1
something 1
to 1
tell 1
or 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
act 1
so 1
exclaimed 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
out 1
with 1
it 1
and 1
nobody 1
here 1
ll 1
ever 1
tell 1
lad 1
Three 1
minutes 1
later 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
sons 1
well 1
armed 1
were 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
and 1
just 1
entering 1
the 1
sumach 1
path 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
their 1
weapons 1
in 1
their 1
hands 1
Huck 1
accompanied 1
them 1
no 1
further 1
He 1
hid 1
behind 1
a 1
great 1
bowlder 1
and 1
fell 1
to 1
listening 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
lagging 1
anxious 1
silence 1
and 1
then 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
explosion 1
of 1
firearms 1
and 1
a 1
cry 1
Huck 1
waited 1
for 1
no 1
particulars 1
He 1
sprang 1
away 1
and 1
sped 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
as 1
fast 1
as 1
his 1
legs 1
could 1
carry 1
him 1
CHAPTER 1
XXX 1
AS 1
the 1
earliest 1
suspicion 1
of 1
dawn 1
appeared 1
on 1
Sunday 1
morning 1
Huck 1
came 1
groping 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
and 1
rapped 1
gently 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
Welshman 1
s 1
door 1
The 1
inmates 1
were 1
asleep 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sleep 1
that 1
was 1
set 1
on 1
a 1
hair 1
trigger 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
exciting 1
episode 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
A 1
call 1
came 1
from 1
a 1
window 1
Who 1
s 1
there 1
Huck 1
s 1
scared 1
voice 1
answered 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
tone 1
Please 1
let 1
me 1
in 1
It 1
s 1
only 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
It 1
s 1
a 1
name 1
that 1
can 1
open 1
this 1
door 1
night 1
or 1
day 1
lad 1
and 1
welcome 1
These 1
were 1
strange 1
words 1
to 1
the 1
vagabond 1
boy 1
s 1
ears 1
and 1
the 1
pleasantest 1
he 1
had 1
ever 1
heard 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
recollect 1
that 1
the 1
closing 1
word 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
applied 1
in 1
his 1
case 1
before 1
The 1
door 1
was 1
quickly 1
unlocked 1
and 1
he 1
entered 1
Huck 1
was 1
given 1
a 1
seat 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
brace 1
of 1
tall 1
sons 1
speedily 1
dressed 1
themselves 1
Now 1
my 1
boy 1
I 1
hope 1
you 1
re 1
good 1
and 1
hungry 1
because 1
breakfast 1
will 1
be 1
ready 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
sun 1
s 1
up 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
have 1
a 1
piping 1
hot 1
one 1
too 1
make 1
yourself 1
easy 1
about 1
that 1
I 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
hoped 1
you 1
d 1
turn 1
up 1
and 1
stop 1
here 1
last 1
night 1
I 1
was 1
awful 1
scared 1
said 1
Huck 1
and 1
I 1
run 1
I 1
took 1
out 1
when 1
the 1
pistols 1
went 1
off 1
and 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
stop 1
for 1
three 1
mile 1
I 1
ve 1
come 1
now 1
becuz 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
about 1
it 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
I 1
come 1
before 1
daylight 1
becuz 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
want 1
to 1
run 1
across 1
them 1
devils 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
was 1
dead 1
Well 1
poor 1
chap 1
you 1
do 1
look 1
as 1
if 1
you 1
d 1
had 1
a 1
hard 1
night 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
bed 1
here 1
for 1
you 1
when 1
you 1
ve 1
had 1
your 1
breakfast 1
No 1
they 1
ain 1
t 1
dead 1
lad 1
we 1
are 1
sorry 1
enough 1
for 1
that 1
You 1
see 1
we 1
knew 1
right 1
where 1
to 1
put 1
our 1
hands 1
on 1
them 1
by 1
your 1
description 1
so 1
we 1
crept 1
along 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
till 1
we 1
got 1
within 1
fifteen 1
feet 1
of 1
them 1
dark 1
as 1
a 1
cellar 1
that 1
sumach 1
path 1
was 1
and 1
just 1
then 1
I 1
found 1
I 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
sneeze 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
meanest 1
kind 1
of 1
luck 1
I 1
tried 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
back 1
but 1
no 1
use 1
twas 1
bound 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
it 1
did 1
come 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
lead 1
with 1
my 1
pistol 1
raised 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
sneeze 1
started 1
those 1
scoundrels 1
a 1
rustling 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
path 1
I 1
sung 1
out 1
Fire 1
boys 1
and 1
blazed 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
rustling 1
was 1
So 1
did 1
the 1
boys 1
But 1
they 1
were 1
off 1
in 1
a 1
jiffy 1
those 1
villains 1
and 1
we 1
after 1
them 1
down 1
through 1
the 1
woods 1
I 1
judge 1
we 1
never 1
touched 1
them 1
They 1
fired 1
a 1
shot 1
apiece 1
as 1
they 1
started 1
but 1
their 1
bullets 1
whizzed 1
by 1
and 1
didn 1
t 1
do 1
us 1
any 1
harm 1
As 1
soon 1
as 1
we 1
lost 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
their 1
feet 1
we 1
quit 1
chasing 1
and 1
went 1
down 1
and 1
stirred 1
up 1
the 1
constables 1
They 1
got 1
a 1
posse 1
together 1
and 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
guard 1
the 1
river 1
bank 1
and 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
light 1
the 1
sheriff 1
and 1
a 1
gang 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
beat 1
up 1
the 1
woods 1
My 1
boys 1
will 1
be 1
with 1
them 1
presently 1
I 1
wish 1
we 1
had 1
some 1
sort 1
of 1
description 1
of 1
those 1
rascals 1
twould 1
help 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
But 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
see 1
what 1
they 1
were 1
like 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
lad 1
I 1
suppose 1
Oh 1
yes 1
I 1
saw 1
them 1
downtown 1
and 1
follered 1
them 1
Splendid 1
Describe 1
them 1
describe 1
them 1
my 1
boy 1
One 1
s 1
the 1
old 1
deaf 1
and 1
dumb 1
Spaniard 1
that 1
s 1
ben 1
around 1
here 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
s 1
a 1
mean 1
looking 1
ragged 1
That 1
s 1
enough 1
lad 1
we 1
know 1
the 1
men 1
Happened 1
on 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
one 1
day 1
and 1
they 1
slunk 1
away 1
Off 1
with 1
you 1
boys 1
and 1
tell 1
the 1
sheriff 1
get 1
your 1
breakfast 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
The 1
Welshman 1
s 1
sons 1
departed 1
at 1
once 1
As 1
they 1
were 1
leaving 1
the 1
room 1
Huck 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
Oh 1
please 1
don 1
t 1
tell 1
any 1
body 1
it 1
was 1
me 1
that 1
blowed 1
on 1
them 1
Oh 1
please 1
All 1
right 1
if 1
you 1
say 1
it 1
Huck 1
but 1
you 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
credit 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
did 1
Oh 1
no 1
no 1
Please 1
don 1
t 1
tell 1
When 1
the 1
young 1
men 1
were 1
gone 1
the 1
old 1
Welshman 1
said 1
They 1
won 1
t 1
tell 1
and 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
But 1
why 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
want 1
it 1
known 1
Huck 1
would 1
not 1
explain 1
further 1
than 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
already 1
knew 1
too 1
much 1
about 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
men 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
the 1
man 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
knew 1
anything 1
against 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
whole 1
world 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
killed 1
for 1
knowing 1
it 1
sure 1
The 1
old 1
man 1
promised 1
secrecy 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
said 1
How 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
follow 1
these 1
fellows 1
lad 1
Were 1
they 1
looking 1
suspicious 1
Huck 1
was 1
silent 1
while 1
he 1
framed 1
a 1
duly 1
cautious 1
reply 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
Well 1
you 1
see 1
I 1
m 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
hard 1
lot 1
least 1
everybody 1
says 1
so 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
see 1
nothing 1
agin 1
it 1
and 1
sometimes 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
sleep 1
much 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
thinking 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
sort 1
of 1
trying 1
to 1
strike 1
out 1
a 1
new 1
way 1
of 1
doing 1
That 1
was 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
it 1
last 1
night 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
sleep 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
come 1
along 1
upstreet 1
bout 1
midnight 1
a 1
turning 1
it 1
all 1
over 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
that 1
old 1
shackly 1
brick 1
store 1
by 1
the 1
Temperance 1
Tavern 1
I 1
backed 1
up 1
agin 1
the 1
wall 1
to 1
have 1
another 1
think 1
Well 1
just 1
then 1
along 1
comes 1
these 1
two 1
chaps 1
slipping 1
along 1
close 1
by 1
me 1
with 1
something 1
under 1
their 1
arm 1
and 1
I 1
reckoned 1
they 1
d 1
stole 1
it 1
One 1
was 1
a 1
smoking 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
one 1
wanted 1
a 1
light 1
so 1
they 1
stopped 1
right 1
before 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
cigars 1
lit 1
up 1
their 1
faces 1
and 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
big 1
one 1
was 1
the 1
deaf 1
and 1
dumb 1
Spaniard 1
by 1
his 1
white 1
whiskers 1
and 1
the 1
patch 1
on 1
his 1
eye 1
and 1
t 1
other 1
one 1
was 1
a 1
rusty 1
ragged 1
looking 1
devil 1
Could 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
rags 1
by 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
cigars 1
This 1
staggered 1
Huck 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
but 1
somehow 1
it 1
seems 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
did 1
Then 1
they 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
you 1
Follered 1
em 1
yes 1
That 1
was 1
it 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
up 1
they 1
sneaked 1
along 1
so 1
I 1
dogged 1
em 1
to 1
the 1
widder 1
s 1
stile 1
and 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
and 1
heard 1
the 1
ragged 1
one 1
beg 1
for 1
the 1
widder 1
and 1
the 1
Spaniard 1
swear 1
he 1
d 1
spile 1
her 1
looks 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
two 1
What 1
The 1
deaf 1
and 1
dumb 1
man 1
said 1
all 1
that 1
Huck 1
had 1
made 1
another 1
terrible 1
mistake 1
He 1
was 1
trying 1
his 1
best 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
from 1
getting 1
the 1
faintest 1
hint 1
of 1
who 1
the 1
Spaniard 1
might 1
be 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
tongue 1
seemed 1
determined 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
into 1
trouble 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
all 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
He 1
made 1
several 1
efforts 1
to 1
creep 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
scrape 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
eye 1
was 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
blunder 1
after 1
blunder 1
Presently 1
the 1
Welshman 1
said 1
My 1
boy 1
don 1
t 1
be 1
afraid 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
wouldn 1
t 1
hurt 1
a 1
hair 1
of 1
your 1
head 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
No 1
I 1
d 1
protect 1
you 1
I 1
d 1
protect 1
you 1
This 1
Spaniard 1
is 1
not 1
deaf 1
and 1
dumb 1
you 1
ve 1
let 1
that 1
slip 1
without 1
intending 1
it 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
cover 1
that 1
up 1
now 1
You 1
know 1
something 1
about 1
that 1
Spaniard 1
that 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
keep 1
dark 1
Now 1
trust 1
me 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
and 1
trust 1
me 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
betray 1
you 1
Huck 1
looked 1
into 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
s 1
honest 1
eyes 1
a 1
moment 1
then 1
bent 1
over 1
and 1
whispered 1
in 1
his 1
ear 1
Tain 1
t 1
a 1
Spaniard 1
it 1
s 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
The 1
Welshman 1
almost 1
jumped 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
chair 1
In 1
a 1
moment 1
he 1
said 1
It 1
s 1
all 1
plain 1
enough 1
now 1
When 1
you 1
talked 1
about 1
notching 1
ears 1
and 1
slitting 1
noses 1
I 1
judged 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
your 1
own 1
embellishment 1
because 1
white 1
men 1
don 1
t 1
take 1
that 1
sort 1
of 1
revenge 1
But 1
an 1
Injun 1
That 1
s 1
a 1
different 1
matter 1
altogether 1
During 1
breakfast 1
the 1
talk 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
which 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
sons 1
had 1
done 1
before 1
going 1
to 1
bed 1
was 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
lantern 1
and 1
examine 1
the 1
stile 1
and 1
its 1
vicinity 1
for 1
marks 1
of 1
blood 1
They 1
found 1
none 1
but 1
captured 1
a 1
bulky 1
bundle 1
of 1
Of 1
what 1
If 1
the 1
words 1
had 1
been 1
lightning 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
leaped 1
with 1
a 1
more 1
stunning 1
suddenness 1
from 1
Huck 1
s 1
blanched 1
lips 1
His 1
eyes 1
were 1
staring 1
wide 1
now 1
and 1
his 1
breath 1
suspended 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
answer 1
The 1
Welshman 1
started 1
stared 1
in 1
return 1
three 1
seconds 1
five 1
seconds 1
ten 1
then 1
replied 1
Of 1
burglar 1
s 1
tools 1
Why 1
what 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
Huck 1
sank 1
back 1
panting 1
gently 1
but 1
deeply 1
unutterably 1
grateful 1
The 1
Welshman 1
eyed 1
him 1
gravely 1
curiously 1
and 1
presently 1
said 1
Yes 1
burglar 1
s 1
tools 1
That 1
appears 1
to 1
relieve 1
you 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
But 1
what 1
did 1
give 1
you 1
that 1
turn 1
What 1
were 1
you 1
expecting 1
we 1
d 1
found 1
Huck 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
close 1
place 1
the 1
inquiring 1
eye 1
was 1
upon 1
him 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
given 1
anything 1
for 1
material 1
for 1
a 1
plausible 1
answer 1
nothing 1
suggested 1
itself 1
the 1
inquiring 1
eye 1
was 1
boring 1
deeper 1
and 1
deeper 1
a 1
senseless 1
reply 1
offered 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
weigh 1
it 1
so 1
at 1
a 1
venture 1
he 1
uttered 1
it 1
feebly 1
Sunday 1
school 1
books 1
maybe 1
Poor 1
Huck 1
was 1
too 1
distressed 1
to 1
smile 1
but 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
laughed 1
loud 1
and 1
joyously 1
shook 1
up 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
his 1
anatomy 1
from 1
head 1
to 1
foot 1
and 1
ended 1
by 1
saying 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
laugh 1
was 1
money 1
in 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
pocket 1
because 1
it 1
cut 1
down 1
the 1
doctor 1
s 1
bill 1
like 1
everything 1
Then 1
he 1
added 1
Poor 1
old 1
chap 1
you 1
re 1
white 1
and 1
jaded 1
you 1
ain 1
t 1
well 1
a 1
bit 1
no 1
wonder 1
you 1
re 1
a 1
little 1
flighty 1
and 1
off 1
your 1
balance 1
But 1
you 1
ll 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
Rest 1
and 1
sleep 1
will 1
fetch 1
you 1
out 1
all 1
right 1
I 1
hope 1
Huck 1
was 1
irritated 1
to 1
think 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
such 1
a 1
goose 1
and 1
betrayed 1
such 1
a 1
suspicious 1
excitement 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
dropped 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
the 1
parcel 1
brought 1
from 1
the 1
tavern 1
was 1
the 1
treasure 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
talk 1
at 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
stile 1
He 1
had 1
only 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
treasure 1
however 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
known 1
that 1
it 1
wasn 1
t 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
suggestion 1
of 1
a 1
captured 1
bundle 1
was 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
his 1
self 1
possession 1
But 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
he 1
felt 1
glad 1
the 1
little 1
episode 1
had 1
happened 1
for 1
now 1
he 1
knew 1
beyond 1
all 1
question 1
that 1
that 1
bundle 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
bundle 1
and 1
so 1
his 1
mind 1
was 1
at 1
rest 1
and 1
exceedingly 1
comfortable 1
In 1
fact 1
everything 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
drifting 1
just 1
in 1
the 1
right 1
direction 1
now 1
the 1
treasure 1
must 1
be 1
still 1
in 1
No 1
the 1
men 1
would 1
be 1
captured 1
and 1
jailed 1
that 1
day 1
and 1
he 1
and 1
Tom 1
could 1
seize 1
the 1
gold 1
that 1
night 1
without 1
any 1
trouble 1
or 1
any 1
fear 1
of 1
interruption 1
Just 1
as 1
breakfast 1
was 1
completed 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
knock 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
Huck 1
jumped 1
for 1
a 1
hiding 1
place 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
mind 1
to 1
be 1
connected 1
even 1
remotely 1
with 1
the 1
late 1
event 1
The 1
Welshman 1
admitted 1
several 1
ladies 1
and 1
gentlemen 1
among 1
them 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
and 1
noticed 1
that 1
groups 1
of 1
citizens 1
were 1
climbing 1
up 1
the 1
hill 1
to 1
stare 1
at 1
the 1
stile 1
So 1
the 1
news 1
had 1
spread 1
The 1
Welshman 1
had 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
to 1
the 1
visitors 1
The 1
widow 1
s 1
gratitude 1
for 1
her 1
preservation 1
was 1
outspoken 1
Don 1
t 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
about 1
it 1
madam 1
There 1
s 1
another 1
that 1
you 1
re 1
more 1
beholden 1
to 1
than 1
you 1
are 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
my 1
boys 1
maybe 1
but 1
he 1
don 1
t 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
name 1
We 1
wouldn 1
t 1
have 1
been 1
there 1
but 1
for 1
him 1
Of 1
course 1
this 1
excited 1
a 1
curiosity 1
so 1
vast 1
that 1
it 1
almost 1
belittled 1
the 1
main 1
matter 1
but 1
the 1
Welshman 1
allowed 1
it 1
to 1
eat 1
into 1
the 1
vitals 1
of 1
his 1
visitors 1
and 1
through 1
them 1
be 1
transmitted 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
for 1
he 1
refused 1
to 1
part 1
with 1
his 1
secret 1
When 1
all 1
else 1
had 1
been 1
learned 1
the 1
widow 1
said 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
sleep 1
reading 1
in 1
bed 1
and 1
slept 1
straight 1
through 1
all 1
that 1
noise 1
Why 1
didn 1
t 1
you 1
come 1
and 1
wake 1
me 1
We 1
judged 1
it 1
warn 1
t 1
worth 1
while 1
Those 1
fellows 1
warn 1
t 1
likely 1
to 1
come 1
again 1
they 1
hadn 1
t 1
any 1
tools 1
left 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
and 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
waking 1
you 1
up 1
and 1
scaring 1
you 1
to 1
death 1
My 1
three 1
negro 1
men 1
stood 1
guard 1
at 1
your 1
house 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
They 1
ve 1
just 1
come 1
back 1
More 1
visitors 1
came 1
and 1
the 1
story 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
told 1
and 1
retold 1
for 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
more 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
Sabbath 1
school 1
during 1
day 1
school 1
vacation 1
but 1
everybody 1
was 1
early 1
at 1
church 1
The 1
stirring 1
event 1
was 1
well 1
canvassed 1
News 1
came 1
that 1
not 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
villains 1
had 1
been 1
yet 1
discovered 1
When 1
the 1
sermon 1
was 1
finished 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
s 1
wife 1
dropped 1
alongside 1
of 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
as 1
she 1
moved 1
down 1
the 1
aisle 1
with 1
the 1
crowd 1
and 1
said 1
Is 1
my 1
Becky 1
going 1
to 1
sleep 1
all 1
day 1
I 1
just 1
expected 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
tired 1
to 1
death 1
Your 1
Becky 1
Yes 1
with 1
a 1
startled 1
look 1
didn 1
t 1
she 1
stay 1
with 1
you 1
last 1
night 1
Why 1
no 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
turned 1
pale 1
and 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
pew 1
just 1
as 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
talking 1
briskly 1
with 1
a 1
friend 1
passed 1
by 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
said 1
Goodmorning 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
Goodmorning 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
a 1
boy 1
that 1
s 1
turned 1
up 1
missing 1
I 1
reckon 1
my 1
Tom 1
stayed 1
at 1
your 1
house 1
last 1
night 1
one 1
of 1
you 1
And 1
now 1
he 1
s 1
afraid 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
church 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
settle 1
with 1
him 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
feebly 1
and 1
turned 1
paler 1
than 1
ever 1
He 1
didn 1
t 1
stay 1
with 1
us 1
said 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
beginning 1
to 1
look 1
uneasy 1
A 1
marked 1
anxiety 1
came 1
into 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
face 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
have 1
you 1
seen 1
my 1
Tom 1
this 1
morning 1
No 1
m 1
When 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
him 1
last 1
Joe 1
tried 1
to 1
remember 1
but 1
was 1
not 1
sure 1
he 1
could 1
say 1
The 1
people 1
had 1
stopped 1
moving 1
out 1
of 1
church 1
Whispers 1
passed 1
along 1
and 1
a 1
boding 1
uneasiness 1
took 1
possession 1
of 1
every 1
countenance 1
Children 1
were 1
anxiously 1
questioned 1
and 1
young 1
teachers 1
They 1
all 1
said 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
noticed 1
whether 1
Tom 1
and 1
Becky 1
were 1
on 1
board 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
on 1
the 1
homeward 1
trip 1
it 1
was 1
dark 1
no 1
one 1
thought 1
of 1
inquiring 1
if 1
any 1
one 1
was 1
missing 1
One 1
young 1
man 1
finally 1
blurted 1
out 1
his 1
fear 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
swooned 1
away 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
fell 1
to 1
crying 1
and 1
wringing 1
her 1
hands 1
The 1
alarm 1
swept 1
from 1
lip 1
to 1
lip 1
from 1
group 1
to 1
group 1
from 1
street 1
to 1
street 1
and 1
within 1
five 1
minutes 1
the 1
bells 1
were 1
wildly 1
clanging 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
town 1
was 1
up 1
The 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
episode 1
sank 1
into 1
instant 1
insignificance 1
the 1
burglars 1
were 1
forgotten 1
horses 1
were 1
saddled 1
skiffs 1
were 1
manned 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
ordered 1
out 1
and 1
before 1
the 1
horror 1
was 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
old 1
two 1
hundred 1
men 1
were 1
pouring 1
down 1
highroad 1
and 1
river 1
toward 1
the 1
cave 1
All 1
the 1
long 1
afternoon 1
the 1
village 1
seemed 1
empty 1
and 1
dead 1
Many 1
women 1
visited 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
comfort 1
them 1
They 1
cried 1
with 1
them 1
too 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
still 1
better 1
than 1
words 1
All 1
the 1
tedious 1
night 1
the 1
town 1
waited 1
for 1
news 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
morning 1
dawned 1
at 1
last 1
all 1
the 1
word 1
that 1
came 1
was 1
Send 1
more 1
candles 1
and 1
send 1
food 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
was 1
almost 1
crazed 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
also 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
sent 1
messages 1
of 1
hope 1
and 1
encouragement 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
but 1
they 1
conveyed 1
no 1
real 1
cheer 1
The 1
old 1
Welshman 1
came 1
home 1
toward 1
daylight 1
spattered 1
with 1
candle 1
grease 1
smeared 1
with 1
clay 1
and 1
almost 1
worn 1
out 1
He 1
found 1
Huck 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
bed 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
provided 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
delirious 1
with 1
fever 1
The 1
physicians 1
were 1
all 1
at 1
the 1
cave 1
so 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
came 1
and 1
took 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
patient 1
She 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
do 1
her 1
best 1
by 1
him 1
because 1
whether 1
he 1
was 1
good 1
bad 1
or 1
indifferent 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
Lord 1
s 1
and 1
nothing 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
Lord 1
s 1
was 1
a 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
neglected 1
The 1
Welshman 1
said 1
Huck 1
had 1
good 1
spots 1
in 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
widow 1
said 1
You 1
can 1
depend 1
on 1
it 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
Lord 1
s 1
mark 1
He 1
don 1
t 1
leave 1
it 1
off 1
He 1
never 1
does 1
Puts 1
it 1
somewhere 1
on 1
every 1
creature 1
that 1
comes 1
from 1
his 1
hands 1
Early 1
in 1
the 1
forenoon 1
parties 1
of 1
jaded 1
men 1
began 1
to 1
straggle 1
into 1
the 1
village 1
but 1
the 1
strongest 1
of 1
the 1
citizens 1
continued 1
searching 1
All 1
the 1
news 1
that 1
could 1
be 1
gained 1
was 1
that 1
remotenesses 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
were 1
being 1
ransacked 1
that 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
visited 1
before 1
that 1
every 1
corner 1
and 1
crevice 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
thoroughly 1
searched 1
that 1
wherever 1
one 1
wandered 1
through 1
the 1
maze 1
of 1
passages 1
lights 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
flitting 1
hither 1
and 1
thither 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
and 1
shoutings 1
and 1
pistol 1
shots 1
sent 1
their 1
hollow 1
reverberations 1
to 1
the 1
ear 1
down 1
the 1
sombre 1
aisles 1
In 1
one 1
place 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
section 1
usually 1
traversed 1
by 1
tourists 1
the 1
names 1
BECKY 1
TOM 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
traced 1
upon 1
the 1
rocky 1
wall 1
with 1
candle 1
smoke 1
and 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
a 1
grease 1
soiled 1
bit 1
of 1
ribbon 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
recognized 1
the 1
ribbon 1
and 1
cried 1
over 1
it 1
She 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
last 1
relic 1
she 1
should 1
ever 1
have 1
of 1
her 1
child 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
other 1
memorial 1
of 1
her 1
could 1
ever 1
be 1
so 1
precious 1
because 1
this 1
one 1
parted 1
latest 1
from 1
the 1
living 1
body 1
before 1
the 1
awful 1
death 1
came 1
Some 1
said 1
that 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
a 1
far 1
away 1
speck 1
of 1
light 1
would 1
glimmer 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
glorious 1
shout 1
would 1
burst 1
forth 1
and 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
men 1
go 1
trooping 1
down 1
the 1
echoing 1
aisle 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
sickening 1
disappointment 1
always 1
followed 1
the 1
children 1
were 1
not 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
searcher 1
s 1
light 1
Three 1
dreadful 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
dragged 1
their 1
tedious 1
hours 1
along 1
and 1
the 1
village 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
hopeless 1
stupor 1
No 1
one 1
had 1
heart 1
for 1
anything 1
The 1
accidental 1
discovery 1
just 1
made 1
that 1
the 1
proprietor 1
of 1
the 1
Temperance 1
Tavern 1
kept 1
liquor 1
on 1
his 1
premises 1
scarcely 1
fluttered 1
the 1
public 1
pulse 1
tremendous 1
as 1
the 1
fact 1
was 1
In 1
a 1
lucid 1
interval 1
Huck 1
feebly 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
taverns 1
and 1
finally 1
asked 1
dimly 1
dreading 1
the 1
worst 1
if 1
anything 1
had 1
been 1
discovered 1
at 1
the 1
Temperance 1
Tavern 1
since 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
ill 1
Yes 1
said 1
the 1
widow 1
Huck 1
started 1
up 1
in 1
bed 1
wildeyed 1
What 1
What 1
was 1
it 1
Liquor 1
and 1
the 1
place 1
has 1
been 1
shut 1
up 1
Lie 1
down 1
child 1
what 1
a 1
turn 1
you 1
did 1
give 1
me 1
Only 1
tell 1
me 1
just 1
one 1
thing 1
only 1
just 1
one 1
please 1
Was 1
it 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
that 1
found 1
it 1
The 1
widow 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
Hush 1
hush 1
child 1
hush 1
I 1
ve 1
told 1
you 1
before 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
talk 1
You 1
are 1
very 1
very 1
sick 1
Then 1
nothing 1
but 1
liquor 1
had 1
been 1
found 1
there 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
great 1
powwow 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
gold 1
So 1
the 1
treasure 1
was 1
gone 1
forever 1
gone 1
forever 1
But 1
what 1
could 1
she 1
be 1
crying 1
about 1
Curious 1
that 1
she 1
should 1
cry 1
These 1
thoughts 1
worked 1
their 1
dim 1
way 1
through 1
Huck 1
s 1
mind 1
and 1
under 1
the 1
weariness 1
they 1
gave 1
him 1
he 1
fell 1
asleep 1
The 1
widow 1
said 1
to 1
herself 1
There 1
he 1
s 1
asleep 1
poor 1
wreck 1

Sawyer 1

it 1
Pity 1
but 1
somebody 1
could 1
find 1
Tom 1

Ah 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
many 1
left 1
now 1
that 1
s 1
got 1
hope 1
enough 1
or 1
strength 1
enough 1
either 1
to 1
go 1
on 1
searching 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXI 1
NOW 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
Tom 1
and 1
Becky 1
s 1
share 1
in 1
the 1
picnic 1
They 1
tripped 1
along 1
the 1
murky 1
aisles 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
visiting 1
the 1
familiar 1
wonders 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
wonders 1
dubbed 1
with 1
rather 1
over 1
descriptive 1
names 1
such 1
as 1
The 1
Drawing 1
Room 1
The 1
Cathedral 1
Aladdin 1
s 1
Palace 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
Presently 1
the 1
hide 1
and 1
seek 1
frolicking 1
began 1
and 1
Tom 1
and 1
Becky 1
engaged 1
in 1
it 1
with 1
zeal 1
until 1
the 1
exertion 1
began 1
to 1
grow 1
a 1
trifle 1
wearisome 1
then 1
they 1
wandered 1
down 1
a 1
sinuous 1
avenue 1
holding 1
their 1
candles 1
aloft 1
and 1
reading 1
the 1
tangled 1
webwork 1
of 1
names 1
dates 1
postoffice 1
addresses 1
and 1
mottoes 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
rocky 1
walls 1
had 1
been 1
frescoed 1
in 1
candle 1
smoke 1
Still 1
drifting 1
along 1
and 1
talking 1
they 1
scarcely 1
noticed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
now 1
in 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
whose 1
walls 1
were 1
not 1
frescoed 1
They 1
smoked 1
their 1
own 1
names 1
under 1
an 1
overhanging 1
shelf 1
and 1
moved 1
on 1
Presently 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
a 1
little 1
stream 1
of 1
water 1
trickling 1
over 1
a 1
ledge 1
and 1
carrying 1
a 1
limestone 1
sediment 1
with 1
it 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
slow 1
dragging 1
ages 1
formed 1
a 1
laced 1
and 1
ruffled 1
Niagara 1
in 1
gleaming 1
and 1
imperishable 1
stone 1
Tom 1
squeezed 1
his 1
small 1
body 1
behind 1
it 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
illuminate 1
it 1
for 1
Becky 1
s 1
gratification 1
He 1
found 1
that 1
it 1
curtained 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
steep 1
natural 1
stairway 1
which 1
was 1
enclosed 1
between 1
narrow 1
walls 1
and 1
at 1
once 1
the 1
ambition 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
discoverer 1
seized 1
him 1
Becky 1
responded 1
to 1
his 1
call 1
and 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
smoke 1
mark 1
for 1
future 1
guidance 1
and 1
started 1
upon 1
their 1
quest 1
They 1
wound 1
this 1
way 1
and 1
that 1
far 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
secret 1
depths 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
made 1
another 1
mark 1
and 1
branched 1
off 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
novelties 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
upper 1
world 1
about 1
In 1
one 1
place 1
they 1
found 1
a 1
spacious 1
cavern 1
from 1
whose 1
ceiling 1
depended 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
shining 1
stalactites 1
of 1
the 1
length 1
and 1
circumference 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
leg 1
they 1
walked 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
wondering 1
and 1
admiring 1
and 1
presently 1
left 1
it 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
numerous 1
passages 1
that 1
opened 1
into 1
it 1
This 1
shortly 1
brought 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
bewitching 1
spring 1
whose 1
basin 1
was 1
incrusted 1
with 1
a 1
frostwork 1
of 1
glittering 1
crystals 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
cavern 1
whose 1
walls 1
were 1
supported 1
by 1
many 1
fantastic 1
pillars 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
formed 1
by 1
the 1
joining 1
of 1
great 1
stalactites 1
and 1
stalagmites 1
together 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
ceaseless 1
water 1
drip 1
of 1
centuries 1
Under 1
the 1
roof 1
vast 1
knots 1
of 1
bats 1
had 1
packed 1
themselves 1
together 1
thousands 1
in 1
a 1
bunch 1
the 1
lights 1
disturbed 1
the 1
creatures 1
and 1
they 1
came 1
flocking 1
down 1
by 1
hundreds 1
squeaking 1
and 1
darting 1
furiously 1
at 1
the 1
candles 1
Tom 1
knew 1
their 1
ways 1
and 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
conduct 1
He 1
seized 1
Becky 1
s 1
hand 1
and 1
hurried 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
first 1
corridor 1
that 1
offered 1
and 1
none 1
too 1
soon 1
for 1
a 1
bat 1
struck 1
Becky 1
s 1
light 1
out 1
with 1
its 1
wing 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
passing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
The 1
bats 1
chased 1
the 1
children 1
a 1
good 1
distance 1
but 1
the 1
fugitives 1
plunged 1
into 1
every 1
new 1
passage 1
that 1
offered 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
got 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
perilous 1
things 1
Tom 1
found 1
a 1
subterranean 1
lake 1
shortly 1
which 1
stretched 1
its 1
dim 1
length 1
away 1
until 1
its 1
shape 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
the 1
shadows 1
He 1
wanted 1
to 1
explore 1
its 1
borders 1
but 1
concluded 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
best 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
rest 1
awhile 1
first 1
Now 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
the 1
deep 1
stillness 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
laid 1
a 1
clammy 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
spirits 1
of 1
the 1
children 1
Becky 1
said 1
Why 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
notice 1
but 1
it 1
seems 1
ever 1
so 1
long 1
since 1
I 1
heard 1
any 1
of 1
the 1
others 1
Come 1
to 1
think 1
Becky 1
we 1
are 1
away 1
down 1
below 1
them 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
how 1
far 1
away 1
north 1
or 1
south 1
or 1
east 1
or 1
whichever 1
it 1
is 1
We 1
couldn 1
t 1
hear 1
them 1
here 1
Becky 1
grew 1
apprehensive 1
I 1
wonder 1
how 1
long 1
we 1
ve 1
been 1
down 1
here 1
Tom 1
We 1
better 1
start 1
back 1
Yes 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
better 1
P 1
raps 1
we 1
better 1
Can 1
you 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
Tom 1
It 1
s 1
all 1
a 1
mixed 1
up 1
crookedness 1
to 1
me 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
could 1
find 1
it 1
but 1
then 1
the 1
bats 1
If 1
they 1
put 1
our 1
candles 1
out 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
an 1
awful 1
fix 1
Let 1
s 1
try 1
some 1
other 1
way 1
so 1
as 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
through 1
there 1
Well 1
But 1
I 1
hope 1
we 1
won 1
t 1
get 1
lost 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
awful 1
and 1
the 1
girl 1
shuddered 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
dreadful 1
possibilities 1
They 1
started 1
through 1
a 1
corridor 1
and 1
traversed 1
it 1
in 1
silence 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
glancing 1
at 1
each 1
new 1
opening 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
anything 1
familiar 1
about 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
it 1
but 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
strange 1
Every 1
time 1
Tom 1
made 1
an 1
examination 1
Becky 1
would 1
watch 1
his 1
face 1
for 1
an 1
encouraging 1
sign 1
and 1
he 1
would 1
say 1
cheerily 1
Oh 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
This 1
ain 1
t 1
the 1
one 1
but 1
we 1
ll 1
come 1
to 1
it 1
right 1
away 1
But 1
he 1
felt 1
less 1
and 1
less 1
hopeful 1
with 1
each 1
failure 1
and 1
presently 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
off 1
into 1
diverging 1
avenues 1
at 1
sheer 1
random 1
in 1
desperate 1
hope 1
of 1
finding 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
was 1
wanted 1
He 1
still 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
leaden 1
dread 1
at 1
his 1
heart 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
had 1
lost 1
their 1
ring 1
and 1
sounded 1
just 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
said 1
All 1
is 1
lost 1
Becky 1
clung 1
to 1
his 1
side 1
in 1
an 1
anguish 1
of 1
fear 1
and 1
tried 1
hard 1
to 1
keep 1
back 1
the 1
tears 1
but 1
they 1
would 1
come 1
At 1
last 1
she 1
said 1
Oh 1
Tom 1
never 1
mind 1
the 1
bats 1
let 1
s 1
go 1
back 1
that 1
way 1
We 1
seem 1
to 1
get 1
worse 1
and 1
worse 1
off 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
Listen 1
said 1
he 1
Profound 1
silence 1
silence 1
so 1
deep 1
that 1
even 1
their 1
breathings 1
were 1
conspicuous 1
in 1
the 1
hush 1
Tom 1
shouted 1
The 1
call 1
went 1
echoing 1
down 1
the 1
empty 1
aisles 1
and 1
died 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
in 1
a 1
faint 1
sound 1
that 1
resembled 1
a 1
ripple 1
of 1
mocking 1
laughter 1
Oh 1
don 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
again 1
Tom 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
horrid 1
said 1
Becky 1
It 1
is 1
horrid 1
but 1
I 1
better 1
Becky 1
they 1
might 1
hear 1
us 1
you 1
know 1
and 1
he 1
shouted 1
again 1
The 1
might 1
was 1
even 1
a 1
chillier 1
horror 1
than 1
the 1
ghostly 1
laughter 1
it 1
so 1
confessed 1
a 1
perishing 1
hope 1
The 1
children 1
stood 1
still 1
and 1
listened 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
result 1
Tom 1
turned 1
upon 1
the 1
back 1
track 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
hurried 1
his 1
steps 1
It 1
was 1
but 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
before 1
a 1
certain 1
indecision 1
in 1
his 1
manner 1
revealed 1
another 1
fearful 1
fact 1
to 1
Becky 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
back 1
Oh 1
Tom 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
make 1
any 1
marks 1
Becky 1
I 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
fool 1
Such 1
a 1
fool 1
I 1
never 1
thought 1
we 1
might 1
want 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
No 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
It 1
s 1
all 1
mixed 1
up 1
Tom 1
Tom 1
we 1
re 1
lost 1
we 1
re 1
lost 1
We 1
never 1
can 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
awful 1
place 1
Oh 1
why 1
did 1
we 1
ever 1
leave 1
the 1
others 1
She 1
sank 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
and 1
burst 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
frenzy 1
of 1
crying 1
that 1
Tom 1
was 1
appalled 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
die 1
or 1
lose 1
her 1
reason 1
He 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
her 1
and 1
put 1
his 1
arms 1
around 1
her 1
she 1
buried 1
her 1
face 1
in 1
his 1
bosom 1
she 1
clung 1
to 1
him 1
she 1
poured 1
out 1
her 1
terrors 1
her 1
unavailing 1
regrets 1
and 1
the 1
far 1
echoes 1
turned 1
them 1
all 1
to 1
jeering 1
laughter 1
Tom 1
begged 1
her 1
to 1
pluck 1
up 1
hope 1
again 1
and 1
she 1
said 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
He 1
fell 1
to 1
blaming 1
and 1
abusing 1
himself 1
for 1
getting 1
her 1
into 1
this 1
miserable 1
situation 1
this 1
had 1
a 1
better 1
effect 1
She 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
try 1
to 1
hope 1
again 1
she 1
would 1
get 1
up 1
and 1
follow 1
wherever 1
he 1
might 1
lead 1
if 1
only 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
talk 1
like 1
that 1
any 1
more 1
For 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
more 1
to 1
blame 1
than 1
she 1
she 1
said 1
So 1
they 1
moved 1
on 1
again 1
aimlessly 1
simply 1
at 1
random 1
all 1
they 1
could 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
move 1
keep 1
moving 1
For 1
a 1
little 1
while 1
hope 1
made 1
a 1
show 1
of 1
reviving 1
not 1
with 1
any 1
reason 1
to 1
back 1
it 1
but 1
only 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
its 1
nature 1
to 1
revive 1
when 1
the 1
spring 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
taken 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
by 1
age 1
and 1
familiarity 1
with 1
failure 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Tom 1
took 1
Becky 1
s 1
candle 1
and 1
blew 1
it 1
out 1
This 1
economy 1
meant 1
so 1
much 1
Words 1
were 1
not 1
needed 1
Becky 1
understood 1
and 1
her 1
hope 1
died 1
again 1
She 1
knew 1
that 1
Tom 1
had 1
a 1
whole 1
candle 1
and 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
pieces 1
in 1
his 1
pockets 1
yet 1
he 1
must 1
economize 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
fatigue 1
began 1
to 1
assert 1
its 1
claims 1
the 1
children 1
tried 1
to 1
pay 1
attention 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
sitting 1
down 1
when 1
time 1
was 1
grown 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
precious 1
moving 1
in 1
some 1
direction 1
in 1
any 1
direction 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
progress 1
and 1
might 1
bear 1
fruit 1
but 1
to 1
sit 1
down 1
was 1
to 1
invite 1
death 1
and 1
shorten 1
its 1
pursuit 1
At 1
last 1
Becky 1
s 1
frail 1
limbs 1
refused 1
to 1
carry 1
her 1
farther 1
She 1
sat 1
down 1
Tom 1
rested 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
they 1
talked 1
of 1
home 1
and 1
the 1
friends 1
there 1
and 1
the 1
comfortable 1
beds 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
the 1
light 1
Becky 1
cried 1
and 1
Tom 1
tried 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
some 1
way 1
of 1
comforting 1
her 1
but 1
all 1
his 1
encouragements 1
were 1
grown 1
thread 1
bare 1
with 1
use 1
and 1
sounded 1
like 1
sarcasms 1
Fatigue 1
bore 1
so 1
heavily 1
upon 1
Becky 1
that 1
she 1
drowsed 1
off 1
to 1
sleep 1
Tom 1
was 1
grateful 1
He 1
sat 1
looking 1
into 1
her 1
drawn 1
face 1
and 1
saw 1
it 1
grow 1
smooth 1
and 1
natural 1
under 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
pleasant 1
dreams 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
smile 1
dawned 1
and 1
rested 1
there 1
The 1
peaceful 1
face 1
reflected 1
somewhat 1
of 1
peace 1
and 1
healing 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
spirit 1
and 1
his 1
thoughts 1
wandered 1
away 1
to 1
bygone 1
times 1
and 1
dreamy 1
memories 1
While 1
he 1
was 1
deep 1
in 1
his 1
musings 1
Becky 1
woke 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
breezy 1
little 1
laugh 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
stricken 1
dead 1
upon 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
a 1
groan 1
followed 1
it 1
Oh 1
how 1
could 1
I 1
sleep 1
I 1
wish 1
I 1
never 1
never 1
had 1
waked 1
No 1
No 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
Tom 1
Don 1
t 1
look 1
so 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
say 1
it 1
again 1
I 1
m 1
glad 1
you 1
ve 1
slept 1
Becky 1
you 1
ll 1
feel 1
rested 1
now 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
find 1
the 1
way 1
out 1
We 1
can 1
try 1
Tom 1
but 1
I 1
ve 1
seen 1
such 1
a 1
beautiful 1
country 1
in 1
my 1
dream 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
there 1
Maybe 1
not 1
maybe 1
not 1
Cheer 1
up 1
Becky 1
and 1
let 1
s 1
go 1
on 1
trying 1
They 1
rose 1
up 1
and 1
wandered 1
along 1
hand 1
in 1
hand 1
and 1
hopeless 1
They 1
tried 1
to 1
estimate 1
how 1
long 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
but 1
all 1
they 1
knew 1
was 1
that 1
it 1
seemed 1
days 1
and 1
weeks 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
plain 1
that 1
this 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
for 1
their 1
candles 1
were 1
not 1
gone 1
yet 1
A 1
long 1
time 1
after 1
this 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
how 1
long 1
Tom 1
said 1
they 1
must 1
go 1
softly 1
and 1
listen 1
for 1
dripping 1
water 1
they 1
must 1
find 1
a 1
spring 1
They 1
found 1
one 1
presently 1
and 1
Tom 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
rest 1
again 1
Both 1
were 1
cruelly 1
tired 1
yet 1
Becky 1
said 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
could 1
go 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
She 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
hear 1
Tom 1
dissent 1
She 1
could 1
not 1
understand 1
it 1
They 1
sat 1
down 1
and 1
Tom 1
fastened 1
his 1
candle 1
to 1
the 1
wall 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
some 1
clay 1
Thought 1
was 1
soon 1
busy 1
nothing 1
was 1
said 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
Then 1
Becky 1
broke 1
the 1
silence 1
Tom 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
hungry 1
Tom 1
took 1
something 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket 1
Do 1
you 1
remember 1
this 1
said 1
he 1
Becky 1
almost 1
smiled 1
It 1
s 1
our 1
wedding 1
cake 1
Tom 1
Yes 1
I 1
wish 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
big 1
as 1
a 1
barrel 1
for 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
I 1
saved 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
picnic 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
dream 1
on 1
Tom 1
the 1
way 1
grownup 1
people 1
do 1
with 1
wedding 1
cake 1
but 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
our 1
She 1
dropped 1
the 1
sentence 1
where 1
it 1
was 1
Tom 1
divided 1
the 1
cake 1
and 1
Becky 1
ate 1
with 1
good 1
appetite 1
while 1
Tom 1
nibbled 1
at 1
his 1
moiety 1
There 1
was 1
abundance 1
of 1
cold 1
water 1
to 1
finish 1
the 1
feast 1
with 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Becky 1
suggested 1
that 1
they 1
move 1
on 1
again 1
Tom 1
was 1
silent 1
a 1
moment 1
Then 1
he 1
said 1
Becky 1
can 1
you 1
bear 1
it 1
if 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
Becky 1
s 1
face 1
paled 1
but 1
she 1
thought 1
she 1
could 1
Well 1
then 1
Becky 1
we 1
must 1
stay 1
here 1
where 1
there 1
s 1
water 1
to 1
drink 1
That 1
little 1
piece 1
is 1
our 1
last 1
candle 1
Becky 1
gave 1
loose 1
to 1
tears 1
and 1
wailings 1
Tom 1
did 1
what 1
he 1
could 1
to 1
comfort 1
her 1
but 1
with 1
little 1
effect 1
At 1
length 1
Becky 1
said 1
Tom 1
Well 1
Becky 1
They 1
ll 1
miss 1
us 1
and 1
hunt 1
for 1
us 1
Yes 1
they 1
will 1
Certainly 1
they 1
will 1
Maybe 1
they 1
re 1
hunting 1
for 1
us 1
now 1
Tom 1
Why 1
I 1
reckon 1
maybe 1
they 1
are 1
I 1
hope 1
they 1
are 1
When 1
would 1
they 1
miss 1
us 1
Tom 1
When 1
they 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
boat 1
I 1
reckon 1
Tom 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
dark 1
then 1
would 1
they 1
notice 1
we 1
hadn 1
t 1
come 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
But 1
anyway 1
your 1
mother 1
would 1
miss 1
you 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
they 1
got 1
home 1
A 1
frightened 1
look 1
in 1
Becky 1
s 1
face 1
brought 1
Tom 1
to 1
his 1
senses 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
blunder 1
Becky 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
home 1
that 1
night 1
The 1
children 1
became 1
silent 1
and 1
thoughtful 1
In 1
a 1
moment 1
a 1
new 1
burst 1
of 1
grief 1
from 1
Becky 1
showed 1
Tom 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
had 1
struck 1
hers 1
also 1
that 1
the 1
Sabbath 1
morning 1
might 1
be 1
half 1
spent 1
before 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
discovered 1
that 1
Becky 1
was 1
not 1
at 1
Mrs 1
Harper 1
s 1
The 1
children 1
fastened 1
their 1
eyes 1
upon 1
their 1
bit 1
of 1
candle 1
and 1
watched 1
it 1
melt 1
slowly 1
and 1
pitilessly 1
away 1
saw 1
the 1
half 1
inch 1
of 1
wick 1
stand 1
alone 1
at 1
last 1
saw 1
the 1
feeble 1
flame 1
rise 1
and 1
fall 1
climb 1
the 1
thin 1
column 1
of 1
smoke 1
linger 1
at 1
its 1
top 1
a 1
moment 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
utter 1
darkness 1
reigned 1
How 1
long 1
afterward 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
Becky 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
slow 1
consciousness 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
crying 1
in 1
Tom 1
s 1
arms 1
neither 1
could 1
tell 1
All 1
that 1
they 1
knew 1
was 1
that 1
after 1
what 1
seemed 1
a 1
mighty 1
stretch 1
of 1
time 1
both 1
awoke 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
dead 1
stupor 1
of 1
sleep 1
and 1
resumed 1
their 1
miseries 1
once 1
more 1
Tom 1
said 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
Sunday 1
now 1
maybe 1
Monday 1
He 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
Becky 1
to 1
talk 1
but 1
her 1
sorrows 1
were 1
too 1
oppressive 1
all 1
her 1
hopes 1
were 1
gone 1
Tom 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
missed 1
long 1
ago 1
and 1
no 1
doubt 1
the 1
search 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
He 1
would 1
shout 1
and 1
maybe 1
some 1
one 1
would 1
come 1
He 1
tried 1
it 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
the 1
distant 1
echoes 1
sounded 1
so 1
hideously 1
that 1
he 1
tried 1
it 1
no 1
more 1
The 1
hours 1
wasted 1
away 1
and 1
hunger 1
came 1
to 1
torment 1
the 1
captives 1
again 1
A 1
portion 1
of 1
Tom 1
s 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
cake 1
was 1
left 1
they 1
divided 1
and 1
ate 1
it 1
But 1
they 1
seemed 1
hungrier 1
than 1
before 1
The 1
poor 1
morsel 1
of 1
food 1
only 1
whetted 1
desire 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Tom 1
said 1
SH 1
Did 1
you 1
hear 1
that 1
Both 1
held 1
their 1
breath 1
and 1
listened 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
sound 1
like 1
the 1
faintest 1
far 1
off 1
shout 1
Instantly 1
Tom 1
answered 1
it 1
and 1
leading 1
Becky 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
started 1
groping 1
down 1
the 1
corridor 1
in 1
its 1
direction 1
Presently 1
he 1
listened 1
again 1
again 1
the 1
sound 1
was 1
heard 1
and 1
apparently 1
a 1
little 1
nearer 1
It 1
s 1
them 1
said 1
Tom 1
they 1
re 1
coming 1
Come 1
along 1
Becky 1
we 1
re 1
all 1
right 1
now 1
The 1
joy 1
of 1
the 1
prisoners 1
was 1
almost 1
overwhelming 1
Their 1
speed 1
was 1
slow 1
however 1
because 1
pitfalls 1
were 1
somewhat 1
common 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
guarded 1
against 1
They 1
shortly 1
came 1
to 1
one 1
and 1
had 1
to 1
stop 1
It 1
might 1
be 1
three 1
feet 1
deep 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
hundred 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
passing 1
it 1
at 1
any 1
rate 1
Tom 1
got 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
reached 1
as 1
far 1
down 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
No 1
bottom 1
They 1
must 1
stay 1
there 1
and 1
wait 1
until 1
the 1
searchers 1
came 1
They 1
listened 1
evidently 1
the 1
distant 1
shoutings 1
were 1
growing 1
more 1
distant 1
a 1
moment 1
or 1
two 1
more 1
and 1
they 1
had 1
gone 1
altogether 1
The 1
heart 1
sinking 1
misery 1
of 1
it 1
Tom 1
whooped 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
hoarse 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
no 1
use 1
He 1
talked 1
hopefully 1
to 1
Becky 1
but 1
an 1
age 1
of 1
anxious 1
waiting 1
passed 1
and 1
no 1
sounds 1
came 1
again 1
The 1
children 1
groped 1
their 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
The 1
weary 1
time 1
dragged 1
on 1
they 1
slept 1
again 1
and 1
awoke 1
famished 1
and 1
woe 1
stricken 1
Tom 1
believed 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
Tuesday 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
Now 1
an 1
idea 1
struck 1
him 1
There 1
were 1
some 1
side 1
passages 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
explore 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
than 1
bear 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
the 1
heavy 1
time 1
in 1
idleness 1
He 1
took 1
a 1
kite 1
line 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
tied 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
projection 1
and 1
he 1
and 1
Becky 1
started 1
Tom 1
in 1
the 1
lead 1
unwinding 1
the 1
line 1
as 1
he 1
groped 1
along 1
At 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
twenty 1
steps 1
the 1
corridor 1
ended 1
in 1
a 1
jumping 1
off 1
place 1
Tom 1
got 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
felt 1
below 1
and 1
then 1
as 1
far 1
around 1
the 1
corner 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
reach 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
conveniently 1
he 1
made 1
an 1
effort 1
to 1
stretch 1
yet 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
and 1
at 1
that 1
moment 1
not 1
twenty 1
yards 1
away 1
a 1
human 1
hand 1
holding 1
a 1
candle 1
appeared 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
rock 1
Tom 1
lifted 1
up 1
a 1
glorious 1
shout 1
and 1
instantly 1
that 1
hand 1
was 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
body 1
it 1
belonged 1
to 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
Tom 1
was 1
paralyzed 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
move 1
He 1
was 1
vastly 1
gratified 1
the 1
next 1
moment 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
Spaniard 1
take 1
to 1
his 1
heels 1
and 1
get 1
himself 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
Tom 1
wondered 1
that 1
Joe 1
had 1
not 1
recognized 1
his 1
voice 1
and 1
come 1
over 1
and 1
killed 1
him 1
for 1
testifying 1
in 1
court 1
But 1
the 1
echoes 1
must 1
have 1
disguised 1
the 1
voice 1
Without 1
doubt 1
that 1
was 1
it 1
he 1
reasoned 1
Tom 1
s 1
fright 1
weakened 1
every 1
muscle 1
in 1
his 1
body 1
He 1
said 1
to 1
himself 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
strength 1
enough 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
he 1
would 1
stay 1
there 1
and 1
nothing 1
should 1
tempt 1
him 1
to 1
run 1
the 1
risk 1
of 1
meeting 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
again 1
He 1
was 1
careful 1
to 1
keep 1
from 1
Becky 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
He 1
told 1
her 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
shouted 1
for 1
luck 1
But 1
hunger 1
and 1
wretchedness 1
rise 1
superior 1
to 1
fears 1
in 1
the 1
long 1
run 1
Another 1
tedious 1
wait 1
at 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
another 1
long 1
sleep 1
brought 1
changes 1
The 1
children 1
awoke 1
tortured 1
with 1
a 1
raging 1
hunger 1
Tom 1
believed 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
Wednesday 1
or 1
Thursday 1
or 1
even 1
Friday 1
or 1
Saturday 1
now 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
search 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
over 1
He 1
proposed 1
to 1
explore 1
another 1
passage 1
He 1
felt 1
willing 1
to 1
risk 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
and 1
all 1
other 1
terrors 1
But 1
Becky 1
was 1
very 1
weak 1
She 1
had 1
sunk 1
into 1
a 1
dreary 1
apathy 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
roused 1
She 1
said 1
she 1
would 1
wait 1
now 1
where 1
she 1
was 1
and 1
die 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
long 1
She 1
told 1
Tom 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
the 1
kite 1
line 1
and 1
explore 1
if 1
he 1
chose 1
but 1
she 1
implored 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
every 1
little 1
while 1
and 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
she 1
made 1
him 1
promise 1
that 1
when 1
the 1
awful 1
time 1
came 1
he 1
would 1
stay 1
by 1
her 1
and 1
hold 1
her 1
hand 1
until 1
all 1
was 1
over 1
Tom 1
kissed 1
her 1
with 1
a 1
choking 1
sensation 1
in 1
his 1
throat 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
show 1
of 1
being 1
confident 1
of 1
finding 1
the 1
searchers 1
or 1
an 1
escape 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
then 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
kite 1
line 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
went 1
groping 1
down 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
passages 1
on 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
knees 1
distressed 1
with 1
hunger 1
and 1
sick 1
with 1
bodings 1
of 1
coming 1
doom 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXII 1
TUESDAY 1
afternoon 1
came 1
and 1
waned 1
to 1
the 1
twilight 1
The 1
village 1
of 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
still 1
mourned 1
The 1
lost 1
children 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
found 1
Public 1
prayers 1
had 1
been 1
offered 1
up 1
for 1
them 1
and 1
many 1
and 1
many 1
a 1
private 1
prayer 1
that 1
had 1
the 1
petitioner 1
s 1
whole 1
heart 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
still 1
no 1
good 1
news 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
The 1
majority 1
of 1
the 1
searchers 1
had 1
given 1
up 1
the 1
quest 1
and 1
gone 1
back 1
to 1
their 1
daily 1
avocations 1
saying 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
plain 1
the 1
children 1
could 1
never 1
be 1
found 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
was 1
very 1
ill 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
delirious 1
People 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
heartbreaking 1
to 1
hear 1
her 1
call 1
her 1
child 1
and 1
raise 1
her 1
head 1
and 1
listen 1
a 1
whole 1
minute 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
then 1
lay 1
it 1
wearily 1
down 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
moan 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
had 1
drooped 1
into 1
a 1
settled 1
melancholy 1
and 1
her 1
gray 1
hair 1
had 1
grown 1
almost 1
white 1
The 1
village 1
went 1
to 1
its 1
rest 1
on 1
Tuesday 1
night 1
sad 1
and 1
forlorn 1
Away 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
a 1
wild 1
peal 1
burst 1
from 1
the 1
village 1
bells 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
moment 1
the 1
streets 1
were 1
swarming 1
with 1
frantic 1
half 1
clad 1
people 1
who 1
shouted 1
Turn 1
out 1
turn 1
out 1
they 1
re 1
found 1
they 1
re 1
found 1
Tin 1
pans 1
and 1
horns 1
were 1
added 1
to 1
the 1
din 1
the 1
population 1
massed 1
itself 1
and 1
moved 1
toward 1
the 1
river 1
met 1
the 1
children 1
coming 1
in 1
an 1
open 1
carriage 1
drawn 1
by 1
shouting 1
citizens 1
thronged 1
around 1
it 1
joined 1
its 1
homeward 1
march 1
and 1
swept 1
magnificently 1
up 1
the 1
main 1
street 1
roaring 1
huzzah 1
after 1
huzzah 1
The 1
village 1
was 1
illuminated 1
nobody 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
again 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
greatest 1
night 1
the 1
little 1
town 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
During 1
the 1
first 1
half 1
hour 1
a 1
procession 1
of 1
villagers 1
filed 1
through 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
s 1
house 1
seized 1
the 1
saved 1
ones 1
and 1
kissed 1
them 1
squeezed 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
s 1
hand 1
tried 1
to 1
speak 1
but 1
couldn 1
t 1
and 1
drifted 1
out 1
raining 1
tears 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
place 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
happiness 1
was 1
complete 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Thatcher 1
s 1
nearly 1
so 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
complete 1
however 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
the 1
messenger 1
dispatched 1
with 1
the 1
great 1
news 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
should 1
get 1
the 1
word 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
Tom 1
lay 1
upon 1
a 1
sofa 1
with 1
an 1
eager 1
auditory 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
told 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
wonderful 1
adventure 1
putting 1
in 1
many 1
striking 1
additions 1
to 1
adorn 1
it 1
withal 1
and 1
closed 1
with 1
a 1
description 1
of 1
how 1
he 1
left 1
Becky 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
an 1
exploring 1
expedition 1
how 1
he 1
followed 1
two 1
avenues 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
his 1
kite 1
line 1
would 1
reach 1
how 1
he 1
followed 1
a 1
third 1
to 1
the 1
fullest 1
stretch 1
of 1
the 1
kite 1
line 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
turn 1
back 1
when 1
he 1
glimpsed 1
a 1
far 1
off 1
speck 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
daylight 1
dropped 1
the 1
line 1
and 1
groped 1
toward 1
it 1
pushed 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
shoulders 1
through 1
a 1
small 1
hole 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
broad 1
Mississippi 1
rolling 1
by 1
And 1
if 1
it 1
had 1
only 1
happened 1
to 1
be 1
night 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
seen 1
that 1
speck 1
of 1
daylight 1
and 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
explored 1
that 1
passage 1
any 1
more 1
He 1
told 1
how 1
he 1
went 1
back 1
for 1
Becky 1
and 1
broke 1
the 1
good 1
news 1
and 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
not 1
to 1
fret 1
her 1
with 1
such 1
stuff 1
for 1
she 1
was 1
tired 1
and 1
knew 1
she 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
die 1
and 1
wanted 1
to 1
He 1
described 1
how 1
he 1
labored 1
with 1
her 1
and 1
convinced 1
her 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
almost 1
died 1
for 1
joy 1
when 1
she 1
had 1
groped 1
to 1
where 1
she 1
actually 1
saw 1
the 1
blue 1
speck 1
of 1
daylight 1
how 1
he 1
pushed 1
his 1
way 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
hole 1
and 1
then 1
helped 1
her 1
out 1
how 1
they 1
sat 1
there 1
and 1
cried 1
for 1
gladness 1
how 1
some 1
men 1
came 1
along 1
in 1
a 1
skiff 1
and 1
Tom 1
hailed 1
them 1
and 1
told 1
them 1
their 1
situation 1
and 1
their 1
famished 1
condition 1
how 1
the 1
men 1
didn 1
t 1
believe 1
the 1
wild 1
tale 1
at 1
first 1
because 1
said 1
they 1
you 1
are 1
five 1
miles 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
below 1
the 1
valley 1
the 1
cave 1
is 1
in 1
then 1
took 1
them 1
aboard 1
rowed 1
to 1
a 1
house 1
gave 1
them 1
supper 1
made 1
them 1
rest 1
till 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
hours 1
after 1
dark 1
and 1
then 1
brought 1
them 1
home 1
Before 1
day 1
dawn 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
and 1
the 1
handful 1
of 1
searchers 1
with 1
him 1
were 1
tracked 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
by 1
the 1
twine 1
clews 1
they 1
had 1
strung 1
behind 1
them 1
and 1
informed 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
news 1
Three 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
of 1
toil 1
and 1
hunger 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
were 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
shaken 1
off 1
at 1
once 1
as 1
Tom 1
and 1
Becky 1
soon 1
discovered 1
They 1
were 1
bedridden 1
all 1
of 1
Wednesday 1
and 1
Thursday 1
and 1
seemed 1
to 1
grow 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
tired 1
and 1
worn 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
Tom 1
got 1
about 1
a 1
little 1
on 1
Thursday 1
was 1
downtown 1
Friday 1
and 1
nearly 1
as 1
whole 1
as 1
ever 1
Saturday 1
but 1
Becky 1
did 1
not 1
leave 1
her 1
room 1
until 1
Sunday 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
looked 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
passed 1
through 1
a 1
wasting 1
illness 1
Tom 1
learned 1
of 1
Huck 1
s 1
sickness 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
on 1
Friday 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
admitted 1
to 1
the 1
bedroom 1
neither 1
could 1
he 1
on 1
Saturday 1
or 1
Sunday 1
He 1
was 1
admitted 1
daily 1
after 1
that 1
but 1
was 1
warned 1
to 1
keep 1
still 1
about 1
his 1
adventure 1
and 1
introduce 1
no 1
exciting 1
topic 1
The 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
stayed 1
by 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
obeyed 1
At 1
home 1
Tom 1
learned 1
of 1
the 1
Cardiff 1
Hill 1
event 1
also 1
that 1
the 1
ragged 1
man 1
s 1
body 1
had 1
eventually 1
been 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
river 1
near 1
the 1
ferry 1
landing 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
drowned 1
while 1
trying 1
to 1
escape 1
perhaps 1
About 1
a 1
fortnight 1
after 1
Tom 1
s 1
rescue 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
he 1
started 1
off 1
to 1
visit 1
Huck 1
who 1
had 1
grown 1
plenty 1
strong 1
enough 1
now 1
to 1
hear 1
exciting 1
talk 1
and 1
Tom 1
had 1
some 1
that 1
would 1
interest 1
him 1
he 1
thought 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
s 1
house 1
was 1
on 1
Tom 1
s 1
way 1
and 1
he 1
stopped 1
to 1
see 1
Becky 1
The 1
Judge 1
and 1
some 1
friends 1
set 1
Tom 1
to 1
talking 1
and 1
some 1
one 1
asked 1
him 1
ironically 1
if 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
like 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
cave 1
again 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
thought 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
mind 1
it 1
The 1
Judge 1
said 1
Well 1
there 1
are 1
others 1
just 1
like 1
you 1
Tom 1
I 1
ve 1
not 1
the 1
least 1
doubt 1
But 1
we 1
have 1
taken 1
care 1
of 1
that 1
Nobody 1
will 1
get 1
lost 1
in 1
that 1
cave 1
any 1
more 1
Why 1
Because 1
I 1
had 1
its 1
big 1
door 1
sheathed 1
with 1
boiler 1
iron 1
two 1
weeks 1
ago 1
and 1
triple 1
locked 1
and 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
the 1
keys 1
Tom 1
turned 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
a 1
sheet 1
What 1
s 1
the 1
matter 1
boy 1
Here 1
run 1
somebody 1
Fetch 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
water 1
The 1
water 1
was 1
brought 1
and 1
thrown 1
into 1
Tom 1
s 1
face 1
Ah 1
now 1
you 1
re 1
all 1
right 1
What 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
you 1
Tom 1
Oh 1
Judge 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXIII 1
WITHIN 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
the 1
news 1
had 1
spread 1
and 1
a 1
dozen 1
skiff 1
loads 1
of 1
men 1
were 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
McDougal 1
s 1
cave 1
and 1
the 1
ferryboat 1
well 1
filled 1
with 1
passengers 1
soon 1
followed 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
skiff 1
that 1
bore 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
When 1
the 1
cave 1
door 1
was 1
unlocked 1
a 1
sorrowful 1
sight 1
presented 1
itself 1
in 1
the 1
dim 1
twilight 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
lay 1
stretched 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
dead 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
crack 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
if 1
his 1
longing 1
eyes 1
had 1
been 1
fixed 1
to 1
the 1
latest 1
moment 1
upon 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
the 1
cheer 1
of 1
the 1
free 1
world 1
outside 1
Tom 1
was 1
touched 1
for 1
he 1
knew 1
by 1
his 1
own 1
experience 1
how 1
this 1
wretch 1
had 1
suffered 1
His 1
pity 1
was 1
moved 1
but 1
nevertheless 1
he 1
felt 1
an 1
abounding 1
sense 1
of 1
relief 1
and 1
security 1
now 1
which 1
revealed 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
a 1
degree 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
fully 1
appreciated 1
before 1
how 1
vast 1
a 1
weight 1
of 1
dread 1
had 1
been 1
lying 1
upon 1
him 1
since 1
the 1
day 1
he 1
lifted 1
his 1
voice 1
against 1
this 1
bloody 1
minded 1
outcast 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
bowie 1

lay 1
close 1
by 1
its 1
blade 1
broken 1
in 1
two 1
The 1
great 1
foundation 1
beam 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
had 1
been 1
chipped 1
and 1
hacked 1
through 1
with 1
tedious 1
labor 1
useless 1
labor 1
too 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
the 1
native 1
rock 1

had 1
wrought 1
no 1
effect 1
the 1
only 1
damage 1
done 1
was 1
to 1
the 1
knife 1
itself 1
But 1
if 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
no 1
stony 1
obstruction 1
there 1
the 1
labor 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
useless 1
still 1
for 1
if 1
the 1
beam 1
had 1
been 1
wholly 1
cut 1
away 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
squeezed 1
his 1
body 1
under 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
he 1
knew 1
it 1
So 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
hacked 1
that 1
place 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
be 1
doing 1
something 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
weary 1
time 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
employ 1
his 1
tortured 1
faculties 1
Ordinarily 1
one 1
could 1
find 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
bits 1
of 1
candle 1
stuck 1
around 1
in 1
the 1
crevices 1
of 1
this 1
vestibule 1
left 1
there 1
by 1
tourists 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
none 1
now 1
The 1
prisoner 1
had 1
searched 1
them 1
out 1
and 1
eaten 1
them 1
He 1
had 1
also 1
contrived 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
few 1
bats 1
and 1
these 1
also 1
he 1
had 1
eaten 1
leaving 1
only 1
their 1
claws 1
The 1
poor 1
unfortunate 1
had 1
starved 1
to 1
death 1
In 1
one 1
place 1
near 1
at 1
hand 1
a 1
stalagmite 1
had 1
been 1
slowly 1
growing 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
ground 1
for 1
ages 1
builded 1
by 1
the 1
water 1
drip 1
from 1
a 1
stalactite 1
overhead 1
The 1
captive 1
had 1
broken 1
off 1
the 1
stalagmite 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
stump 1
had 1
placed 1
a 1
stone 1
wherein 1
he 1
had 1
scooped 1
a 1
shallow 1
hollow 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
precious 1
drop 1
that 1
fell 1
once 1
in 1
every 1
three 1
minutes 1
with 1
the 1
dreary 1
regularity 1
of 1
a 1
clock 1
tick 1
a 1
dessertspoonful 1
once 1
in 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
hours 1
That 1
drop 1
was 1
falling 1
when 1
the 1
Pyramids 1
were 1
new 1
when 1
Troy 1
fell 1
when 1
the 1
foundations 1
of 1
Rome 1
were 1
laid 1
when 1
Christ 1
was 1
crucified 1
when 1
the 1
Conqueror 1
created 1
the 1
British 1
empire 1
when 1
Columbus 1
sailed 1
when 1
the 1
massacre 1
at 1
Lexington 1
was 1
news 1
It 1
is 1
falling 1
now 1
it 1
will 1
still 1
be 1
falling 1
when 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
shall 1
have 1
sunk 1
down 1
the 1
afternoon 1
of 1
history 1
and 1
the 1
twilight 1
of 1
tradition 1
and 1
been 1
swallowed 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
thick 1
night 1
of 1
oblivion 1
Has 1
everything 1
a 1
purpose 1
and 1
a 1
mission 1
Did 1
this 1
drop 1
fall 1
patiently 1
during 1
five 1
thousand 1
years 1
to 1
be 1
ready 1
for 1
this 1
flitting 1
human 1
insect 1
s 1
need 1
and 1
has 1
it 1
another 1
important 1
object 1
to 1
accomplish 1
ten 1
thousand 1
years 1
to 1
come 1
No 1
matter 1
It 1
is 1
many 1
and 1
many 1
a 1
year 1
since 1
the 1
hapless 1
half 1
breed 1
scooped 1
out 1
the 1
stone 1
to 1
catch 1
the 1
priceless 1
drops 1
but 1
to 1
this 1
day 1
the 1
tourist 1
stares 1
longest 1
at 1
that 1
pathetic 1
stone 1
and 1
that 1
slow 1
dropping 1
water 1
when 1
he 1
comes 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
wonders 1
of 1
McDougal 1
s 1
cave 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
cup 1
stands 1
first 1
in 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
the 1
cavern 1
s 1
marvels 1
even 1
Aladdin 1
s 1
Palace 1
cannot 1
rival 1
it 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
was 1
buried 1
near 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
and 1
people 1
flocked 1
there 1
in 1
boats 1
and 1
wagons 1
from 1
the 1
towns 1
and 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
farms 1
and 1
hamlets 1
for 1
seven 1
miles 1
around 1
they 1
brought 1
their 1
children 1
and 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
provisions 1
and 1
confessed 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
had 1
almost 1
as 1
satisfactory 1
a 1
time 1
at 1
the 1
funeral 1
as 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
had 1
at 1
the 1
hanging 1
This 1
funeral 1
stopped 1
the 1
further 1
growth 1
of 1
one 1
thing 1
the 1
petition 1
to 1
the 1
governor 1
for 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
pardon 1
The 1
petition 1
had 1
been 1
largely 1
signed 1
many 1
tearful 1
and 1
eloquent 1
meetings 1
had 1
been 1
held 1
and 1
a 1
committee 1
of 1
sappy 1
women 1
been 1
appointed 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
deep 1
mourning 1
and 1
wail 1
around 1
the 1
governor 1
and 1
implore 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
merciful 1
ass 1
and 1
trample 1
his 1
duty 1
under 1
foot 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
was 1
believed 1
to 1
have 1
killed 1
five 1
citizens 1
of 1
the 1
village 1
but 1
what 1
of 1
that 1
If 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
Satan 1
himself 1
there 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
plenty 1
of 1
weaklings 1
ready 1
to 1
scribble 1
their 1
names 1
to 1
a 1
pardon 1
petition 1
and 1
drip 1
a 1
tear 1
on 1
it 1
from 1
their 1
permanently 1
impaired 1
and 1
leaky 1
water 1
works 1
The 1
morning 1
after 1
the 1
funeral 1
Tom 1
took 1
Huck 1
to 1
a 1
private 1
place 1
to 1
have 1
an 1
important 1
talk 1
Huck 1
had 1
learned 1
all 1
about 1
Tom 1
s 1
adventure 1
from 1
the 1
Welshman 1
and 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
by 1
this 1
time 1
but 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
reckoned 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
thing 1
they 1
had 1
not 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
thing 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
talk 1
about 1
now 1
Huck 1
s 1
face 1
saddened 1
He 1
said 1
I 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
You 1
got 1
into 1
No 1
and 1
never 1
found 1
anything 1
but 1
whiskey 1
Nobody 1
told 1
me 1
it 1
was 1
you 1
but 1
I 1
just 1
knowed 1
it 1
must 1
a 1
ben 1
you 1
soon 1
as 1
I 1
heard 1
bout 1
that 1
whiskey 1
business 1
and 1
I 1
knowed 1
you 1
hadn 1
t 1
got 1
the 1
money 1
becuz 1
you 1
d 1
a 1
got 1
at 1
me 1
some 1
way 1
or 1
other 1
and 1
told 1
me 1
even 1
if 1
you 1
was 1
mum 1
to 1
everybody 1
else 1
Tom 1
something 1
s 1
always 1
told 1
me 1
we 1
d 1
never 1
get 1
holt 1
of 1
that 1
swag 1
Why 1
Huck 1
I 1
never 1
told 1
on 1
that 1
tavern 1
keeper 1
You 1
know 1
his 1
tavern 1
was 1
all 1
right 1
the 1
Saturday 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
picnic 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
remember 1
you 1
was 1
to 1
watch 1
there 1
that 1
night 1
Oh 1
yes 1
Why 1
it 1
seems 1
bout 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
It 1
was 1
that 1
very 1
night 1
that 1
I 1
follered 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
to 1
the 1
widder 1
s 1
You 1
followed 1
him 1
Yes 1
but 1
you 1
keep 1
mum 1
I 1
reckon 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
left 1
friends 1
behind 1
him 1
and 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
want 1
em 1
souring 1
on 1
me 1
and 1
doing 1
me 1
mean 1
tricks 1
If 1
it 1
hadn 1
t 1
ben 1
for 1
me 1
he 1
d 1
be 1
down 1
in 1
Texas 1
now 1
all 1
right 1
Then 1
Huck 1
told 1
his 1
entire 1
adventure 1
in 1
confidence 1
to 1
Tom 1
who 1
had 1
only 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
Welshman 1
s 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
before 1
Well 1
said 1
Huck 1
presently 1
coming 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
question 1
whoever 1
nipped 1
the 1
whiskey 1
in 1
No 1
nipped 1
the 1
money 1
too 1
I 1
reckon 1
anyways 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
goner 1
for 1
us 1
Tom 1
Huck 1
that 1
money 1
wasn 1
t 1
ever 1
in 1
No 1
What 1
Huck 1
searched 1
his 1
comrade 1
s 1
face 1
keenly 1
Tom 1
have 1
you 1
got 1
on 1
the 1
track 1
of 1
that 1
money 1
again 1
Huck 1
it 1
s 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
Huck 1
s 1
eyes 1
blazed 1
Say 1
it 1
again 1
Tom 1
The 1
money 1
s 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
Tom 1
honest 1
injun 1
now 1
is 1
it 1
fun 1
or 1
earnest 1
Earnest 1
Huck 1
just 1
as 1
earnest 1
as 1
ever 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
Will 1
you 1
go 1
in 1
there 1
with 1
me 1
and 1
help 1
get 1
it 1
out 1
I 1
bet 1
I 1
will 1
I 1
will 1
if 1
it 1
s 1
where 1
we 1
can 1
blaze 1
our 1
way 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
not 1
get 1
lost 1
Huck 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
that 1
without 1
the 1
least 1
little 1
bit 1
of 1
trouble 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Good 1
as 1
wheat 1
What 1
makes 1
you 1
think 1
the 1
money 1
s 1
Huck 1
you 1
just 1
wait 1
till 1
we 1
get 1
in 1

If 1

I 1
ll 1
agree 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
drum 1
and 1
every 1
thing 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
I 1

by 1
jings 1
All 1
right 1

whiz 1
When 1
do 1
you 1
say 1
Right 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
say 1

Are 1

strong 1
enough 1
Is 1

cave 1
I 1

on 1
my 1
pins 1
a 1
little 1
three 1
or 1
four 1
days 1
now 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
walk 1
more 1
n 1
a 1
mile 1
Tom 1

I 1
don 1
t 1
think 1
I 1
could 1
It 1
s 1
about 1
five 1
mile 1
into 1
there 1
the 1
way 1
anybody 1
but 1
me 1
would 1
go 1
Huck 1
but 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
mighty 1
short 1
cut 1
that 1
they 1
don 1
t 1
anybody 1
but 1
me 1
know 1
about 1
Huck 1
I 1
ll 1
take 1
you 1
right 1
to 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
skiff 1
I 1
ll 1
float 1
the 1
skiff 1
down 1
there 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
pull 1
it 1
back 1
again 1
all 1
by 1
myself 1
You 1
needn 1
t 1
ever 1
turn 1
your 1
hand 1
over 1
Less 1
start 1
right 1
off 1
Tom 1
All 1
right 1
We 1
want 1
some 1
bread 1
and 1
meat 1
and 1
our 1
pipes 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
bag 1
or 1
two 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
kite 1
strings 1
and 1
some 1
of 1
these 1
new 1
fangled 1
things 1
they 1
call 1
lucifer 1
matches 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
many 1
s 1
the 1
time 1
I 1
wished 1
I 1
had 1
some 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
in 1
there 1
before 1
A 1
trifle 1
after 1
noon 1
the 1
boys 1
borrowed 1
a 1
small 1
skiff 1
from 1
a 1
citizen 1
who 1
was 1
absent 1
and 1
got 1
under 1
way 1
at 1
once 1
When 1
they 1
were 1
several 1
miles 1
below 1
Cave 1
Hollow 1
Tom 1
said 1
Now 1
you 1
see 1
this 1
bluff 1
here 1
looks 1
all 1
alike 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
cave 1
hollow 1
no 1
houses 1
no 1
wood 1
yards 1
bushes 1
all 1
alike 1
But 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
white 1
place 1
up 1
yonder 1
where 1
there 1
s 1
been 1
a 1
landslide 1
Well 1
that 1
s 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
marks 1
We 1
ll 1
get 1
ashore 1
now 1
They 1
landed 1
Now 1
Huck 1
where 1
we 1
re 1
a 1
standing 1
you 1
could 1
touch 1
that 1
hole 1
I 1
got 1
out 1
of 1
with 1
a 1
fishing 1
pole 1
See 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
find 1
it 1
Huck 1
searched 1
all 1
the 1
place 1
about 1
and 1
found 1
nothing 1
Tom 1
proudly 1
marched 1
into 1
a 1
thick 1
clump 1
of 1
sumach 1
bushes 1
and 1
said 1
Here 1
you 1
are 1
Look 1
at 1
it 1
Huck 1
it 1
s 1
the 1
snuggest 1
hole 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
You 1
just 1
keep 1
mum 1
about 1
it 1
All 1
along 1
I 1
ve 1
been 1
wanting 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
robber 1
but 1
I 1
knew 1
I 1
d 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
thing 1
like 1
this 1
and 1
where 1
to 1
run 1
across 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
bother 1
We 1
ve 1
got 1
it 1
now 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
keep 1
it 1
quiet 1
only 1
we 1
ll 1
let 1
Joe 1
Harper 1
and 1
Ben 1
Rogers 1

because 1
of 1
course 1

to 1

a 1
Gang 1
or 1

Gang 1

Huck 1
Well 1

And 1

Oh 1

Waylay 1

mostly 1

way 1
And 1

No 1
not 1
always 1
Hive 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
till 1

a 1
ransom 1
What 1

ransom 1
Money 1
You 1
make 1
them 1

all 1
they 1
can 1

friends 1
and 1
after 1
you 1

kept 1
them 1
a 1
year 1
if 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
raised 1
then 1
you 1
kill 1
them 1
That 1
s 1
the 1
general 1
way 1
Only 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
kill 1
the 1
women 1
You 1
shut 1
up 1
the 1
women 1
but 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
kill 1
them 1
They 1
re 1
always 1
beautiful 1
and 1
rich 1
and 1
awfully 1
scared 1
You 1
take 1
their 1
watches 1
and 1
things 1
but 1
you 1
always 1
take 1
your 1
hat 1
off 1
and 1
talk 1
polite 1
They 1
ain 1
t 1
anybody 1
as 1
polite 1
as 1
robbers 1

in 1
any 1
book 1
Well 1
the 1
women 1

to 1
loving 1
you 1
and 1
after 1
they 1
ve 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
a 1
week 1
or 1
two 1
weeks 1
they 1
stop 1
crying 1
and 1
after 1
that 1
you 1
couldn 1
t 1
get 1
them 1
to 1
leave 1
If 1
you 1
drove 1
them 1
out 1
they 1
d 1
turn 1
right 1
around 1
and 1
come 1
back 1
It 1
s 1
so 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
books 1
Why 1
it 1
s 1
real 1
bully 1
Tom 1
I 1
believe 1
it 1
s 1
better 1
n 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
pirate 1
Yes 1
it 1
s 1
better 1
in 1
some 1
ways 1
because 1
it 1
s 1
close 1
to 1
home 1
and 1
circuses 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
By 1
this 1
time 1
everything 1
was 1
ready 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
entered 1
the 1
hole 1
Tom 1
in 1
the 1
lead 1
They 1
toiled 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
tunnel 1
then 1
made 1
their 1
spliced 1
kite 1
strings 1
fast 1
and 1
moved 1
on 1
A 1
few 1
steps 1
brought 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
spring 1
and 1
Tom 1
felt 1
a 1
shudder 1
quiver 1
all 1
through 1
him 1
He 1
showed 1
Huck 1
the 1
fragment 1
of 1
candle 1
wick 1
perched 1
on 1
a 1
lump 1
of 1
clay 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
described 1
how 1
he 1
and 1
Becky 1
had 1
watched 1
the 1
flame 1
struggle 1
and 1
expire 1
The 1
boys 1
began 1
to 1
quiet 1
down 1
to 1
whispers 1
now 1
for 1
the 1
stillness 1
and 1
gloom 1
of 1
the 1
place 1
oppressed 1
their 1
spirits 1
They 1
went 1
on 1
and 1
presently 1
entered 1
and 1
followed 1
Tom 1
s 1
other 1
corridor 1
until 1
they 1
reached 1
the 1
jumping 1
off 1
place 1
The 1
candles 1
revealed 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
really 1
a 1
precipice 1
but 1
only 1
a 1
steep 1
clay 1
hill 1
twenty 1
or 1
thirty 1
feet 1
high 1
Tom 1
whispered 1
Now 1
I 1
ll 1
show 1
you 1
something 1
Huck 1
He 1
held 1
his 1
candle 1
aloft 1
and 1
said 1
Look 1
as 1
far 1
around 1
the 1
corner 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
Do 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
There 1
on 1
the 1
big 1
rock 1
over 1
yonder 1
done 1
with 1
candle 1
smoke 1
Tom 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
cross 1
Now 1
where 1
s 1
your 1
Number 1
Two 1
under 1
the 1
cross 1
hey 1
Right 1
yonder 1
s 1
where 1
I 1
saw 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
poke 1
up 1
his 1
candle 1
Huck 1
Huck 1
stared 1
at 1
the 1
mystic 1
sign 1
awhile 1
and 1
then 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
shaky 1
voice 1
Tom 1
less 1
git 1
out 1
of 1
here 1
What 1
and 1
leave 1
the 1
treasure 1
Yes 1
leave 1
it 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
ghost 1
is 1
round 1
about 1
there 1
certain 1
No 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
Huck 1
no 1
it 1
ain 1
t 1
It 1
would 1
ha 1
nt 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
died 1
away 1
out 1
at 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
five 1
mile 1
from 1
here 1
No 1
Tom 1
it 1
wouldn 1
t 1
It 1
would 1
hang 1
round 1
the 1
money 1
I 1
know 1
the 1
ways 1
of 1
ghosts 1
and 1
so 1
do 1
you 1
Tom 1
began 1
to 1
fear 1
that 1
Huck 1
was 1
right 1
Mis 1
givings 1
gathered 1
in 1
his 1
mind 1
But 1
presently 1
an 1
idea 1
occurred 1
to 1
him 1
Lookyhere 1
Huck 1
what 1
fools 1
we 1
re 1
making 1
of 1
ourselves 1
Injun 1
Joe 1
s 1
ghost 1
ain 1
t 1
a 1
going 1
to 1
come 1
around 1
where 1
there 1
s 1
a 1
cross 1
The 1
point 1
was 1
well 1
taken 1
It 1
had 1
its 1
effect 1
Tom 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
think 1
of 1
that 1
But 1
that 1
s 1
so 1
It 1
s 1
luck 1
for 1
us 1
that 1
cross 1
is 1
I 1
reckon 1
we 1
ll 1
climb 1
down 1
there 1
and 1
have 1
a 1
hunt 1
for 1
that 1
box 1
Tom 1
went 1
first 1
cutting 1
rude 1
steps 1
in 1
the 1
clay 1
hill 1
as 1
he 1
descended 1
Huck 1
followed 1
Four 1
avenues 1
opened 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
small 1
cavern 1
which 1
the 1
great 1
rock 1
stood 1
in 1
The 1
boys 1
examined 1
three 1
of 1
them 1
with 1
no 1
result 1
They 1
found 1
a 1
small 1
recess 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
nearest 1
the 1
base 1
of 1
the 1
rock 1
with 1
a 1
pallet 1
of 1
blankets 1
spread 1
down 1
in 1
it 1
also 1
an 1
old 1
suspender 1
some 1
bacon 1
rind 1
and 1
the 1
well 1
gnawed 1
bones 1
of 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
fowls 1
But 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
moneybox 1
The 1
lads 1
searched 1
and 1
researched 1
this 1
place 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
Tom 1
said 1
He 1
said 1
under 1
the 1
cross 1
Well 1
this 1
comes 1
nearest 1
to 1
being 1
under 1
the 1
cross 1
It 1
can 1
t 1
be 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
itself 1
because 1
that 1
sets 1
solid 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
They 1
searched 1
everywhere 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
then 1
sat 1
down 1
discouraged 1
Huck 1
could 1
suggest 1
nothing 1
By 1
and 1
by 1
Tom 1
said 1
Lookyhere 1
Huck 1
there 1
s 1
footprints 1
and 1
some 1
candle 1
grease 1
on 1
the 1
clay 1
about 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
this 1
rock 1
but 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
sides 1
Now 1
what 1
s 1
that 1
for 1
I 1
bet 1
you 1
the 1
money 1
is 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
I 1
m 1
going 1
to 1
dig 1
in 1
the 1
clay 1
That 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
bad 1
notion 1
Tom 1
said 1
Huck 1
with 1
animation 1
Tom 1
s 1
real 1
Barlow 1
was 1
out 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
dug 1
four 1
inches 1
before 1
he 1
struck 1
wood 1
Hey 1
Huck 1
you 1
hear 1
that 1
Huck 1
began 1
to 1
dig 1
and 1
scratch 1
now 1
Some 1
boards 1
were 1
soon 1
uncovered 1
and 1
removed 1
They 1
had 1
concealed 1
a 1
natural 1
chasm 1
which 1
led 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
Tom 1
got 1
into 1
this 1
and 1
held 1
his 1
candle 1
as 1
far 1
under 1
the 1
rock 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
but 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
see 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
rift 1
He 1
proposed 1
to 1
explore 1
He 1
stooped 1
and 1
passed 1
under 1
the 1
narrow 1
way 1
descended 1
gradually 1
He 1
followed 1
its 1
winding 1
course 1
first 1
to 1
the 1
right 1
then 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
Huck 1
at 1
his 1
heels 1
Tom 1
turned 1
a 1
short 1
curve 1
by 1
and 1
by 1
and 1
exclaimed 1
My 1
goodness 1
Huck 1
lookyhere 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
treasure 1
box 1
sure 1
enough 1
occupying 1
a 1
snug 1
little 1
cavern 1
along 1
with 1
an 1
empty 1
powder 1
keg 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
guns 1
in 1
leather 1
cases 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
pairs 1
of 1
old 1
moccasins 1
a 1
leather 1
belt 1
and 1
some 1
other 1
rubbish 1
well 1
soaked 1
with 1
the 1
water 1
drip 1
Got 1
it 1
at 1
last 1
said 1
Huck 1
ploughing 1
among 1
the 1
tarnished 1
coins 1
with 1
his 1
hand 1
My 1
but 1
we 1
re 1
rich 1
Tom 1
Huck 1
I 1
always 1
reckoned 1
we 1
d 1
get 1
it 1
It 1
s 1
just 1
too 1
good 1
to 1
believe 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
it 1
sure 1
Say 1
let 1
s 1
not 1
fool 1
around 1
here 1
Let 1
s 1
snake 1
it 1
out 1
Lemme 1
see 1
if 1
I 1
can 1
lift 1
the 1
box 1
It 1
weighed 1
about 1
fifty 1
pounds 1
Tom 1
could 1
lift 1
it 1
after 1
an 1
awkward 1
fashion 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
carry 1
it 1
conveniently 1
I 1
thought 1
so 1
he 1
said 1
They 1
carried 1
it 1
like 1
it 1
was 1
heavy 1
that 1
day 1
at 1
the 1
ha 1
nted 1
house 1
I 1
noticed 1
that 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
was 1
right 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
fetching 1
the 1
little 1
bags 1
along 1
The 1
money 1
was 1
soon 1
in 1
the 1
bags 1
and 1
the 1
boys 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
cross 1
rock 1
Now 1
less 1
fetch 1
the 1
guns 1
and 1
things 1
said 1
Huck 1
No 1
Huck 1
leave 1
them 1
there 1
They 1
re 1
just 1
the 1
tricks 1
to 1
have 1
when 1
we 1
go 1
to 1
robbing 1
We 1
ll 1
keep 1
them 1
there 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
hold 1
our 1
orgies 1
there 1
too 1
It 1
s 1
an 1
awful 1
snug 1
place 1
for 1
orgies 1
What 1
orgies 1
I 1
dono 1
But 1
robbers 1
always 1
have 1
orgies 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
ve 1
got 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
too 1
Come 1
along 1
Huck 1
we 1
ve 1
been 1
in 1
here 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
It 1
s 1
getting 1
late 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
m 1
hungry 1
too 1
We 1
ll 1
eat 1
and 1
smoke 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
skiff 1
They 1
presently 1
emerged 1
into 1
the 1
clump 1
of 1
sumach 1
bushes 1
looked 1
warily 1
out 1
found 1
the 1
coast 1
clear 1
and 1
were 1
soon 1
lunching 1
and 1
smoking 1
in 1
the 1
skiff 1
As 1
the 1
sun 1
dipped 1
toward 1
the 1
horizon 1
they 1
pushed 1
out 1
and 1
got 1
under 1
way 1
Tom 1
skimmed 1
up 1
the 1
shore 1
through 1
the 1
long 1
twilight 1
chatting 1
cheerily 1
with 1
Huck 1
and 1
landed 1
shortly 1
after 1
dark 1
Now 1
Huck 1
said 1
Tom 1
we 1
ll 1
hide 1
the 1
money 1
in 1
the 1
loft 1
of 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
woodshed 1
and 1
I 1
ll 1
come 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
we 1
ll 1
count 1
it 1
and 1
divide 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
ll 1
hunt 1
up 1
a 1
place 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
woods 1
for 1
it 1
where 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
safe 1
Just 1
you 1
lay 1
quiet 1
here 1
and 1
watch 1
the 1
stuff 1
till 1
I 1
run 1
and 1
hook 1
Benny 1
Taylor 1
s 1
little 1
wagon 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
gone 1
a 1
minute 1
He 1
disappeared 1
and 1
presently 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
wagon 1
put 1
the 1
two 1
small 1
sacks 1
into 1
it 1
threw 1
some 1
old 1
rags 1
on 1
top 1
of 1
them 1
and 1
started 1
off 1
dragging 1
his 1
cargo 1
behind 1
him 1
When 1
the 1
boys 1
reached 1
the 1
Welshman 1
s 1
house 1
they 1
stopped 1
to 1
rest 1
Just 1
as 1
they 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
move 1
on 1
the 1
Welshman 1
stepped 1
out 1
and 1
said 1
Hallo 1
who 1
s 1
that 1
Huck 1
and 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
Good 1
Come 1
along 1
with 1
me 1
boys 1
you 1
are 1
keeping 1
everybody 1
waiting 1
Here 1
hurry 1
up 1
trot 1
ahead 1
I 1
ll 1
haul 1
the 1
wagon 1
for 1
you 1
Why 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
as 1
light 1
as 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
Got 1
bricks 1
in 1
it 1
or 1
old 1
metal 1
Old 1
metal 1
said 1
Tom 1
I 1
judged 1
so 1
the 1
boys 1
in 1
this 1
town 1
will 1
take 1
more 1
trouble 1
and 1
fool 1
away 1
more 1
time 1
hunting 1
up 1
six 1
bits 1
worth 1
of 1
old 1
iron 1
to 1
sell 1
to 1
the 1
foundry 1
than 1
they 1
would 1
to 1
make 1
twice 1
the 1
money 1
at 1
regular 1
work 1
But 1
that 1
s 1
human 1
nature 1
hurry 1
along 1
hurry 1
along 1
The 1
boys 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
hurry 1
was 1
about 1
Never 1
mind 1
you 1
ll 1
see 1
when 1
we 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
Huck 1
said 1
with 1
some 1
apprehension 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
long 1
used 1
to 1
being 1
falsely 1
accused 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
we 1
haven 1
t 1
been 1
doing 1
nothing 1
The 1
Welshman 1
laughed 1
Well 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
Huck 1
my 1
boy 1
I 1
don 1
t 1
know 1
about 1
that 1
Ain 1
t 1
you 1
and 1
the 1
widow 1
good 1
friends 1
Yes 1
Well 1
she 1
s 1
ben 1
good 1
friends 1
to 1
me 1
anyway 1
All 1
right 1
then 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
afraid 1
for 1
This 1
question 1
was 1
not 1
entirely 1
answered 1
in 1
Huck 1
s 1
slow 1
mind 1
before 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
pushed 1
along 1
with 1
Tom 1
into 1
Mrs 1
Douglas 1
drawing 1
room 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
left 1
the 1
wagon 1
near 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
followed 1
The 1
place 1
was 1
grandly 1
lighted 1
and 1
everybody 1
that 1
was 1
of 1
any 1
consequence 1
in 1
the 1
village 1
was 1
there 1
The 1
Thatchers 1
were 1
there 1
the 1
Harpers 1
the 1
Rogerses 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
Sid 1
Mary 1
the 1
minister 1
the 1
editor 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
more 1
and 1
all 1
dressed 1
in 1
their 1
best 1
The 1
widow 1
received 1
the 1
boys 1
as 1
heartily 1
as 1
any 1
one 1
could 1
well 1
receive 1
two 1
such 1
looking 1
beings 1
They 1
were 1
covered 1
with 1
clay 1
and 1
candle 1
grease 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
blushed 1
crimson 1
with 1
humiliation 1
and 1
frowned 1
and 1
shook 1
her 1
head 1
at 1
Tom 1
Nobody 1
suffered 1
half 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
the 1
two 1
boys 1
did 1
however 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
said 1
Tom 1
wasn 1
t 1
at 1
home 1
yet 1
so 1
I 1
gave 1
him 1
up 1
but 1
I 1
stumbled 1
on 1
him 1
and 1
Huck 1
right 1
at 1
my 1
door 1
and 1
so 1
I 1
just 1
brought 1
them 1
along 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
And 1
you 1
did 1
just 1
right 1
said 1
the 1
widow 1
Come 1
with 1
me 1
boys 1
She 1
took 1
them 1
to 1
a 1
bedchamber 1
and 1
said 1
Now 1
wash 1
and 1
dress 1
yourselves 1
Here 1
are 1
two 1
new 1

It 1

of 1

This 1

it 1
s 1
for 1
the 1
Welshman 1
and 1
his 1

on 1
account 1
of 1
that 1
scrape 1
they 1
helped 1
her 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
night 1
And 1
say 1
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
something 1
if 1
you 1
want 1
to 1

Well 1
what 1
Why 1

Mr 1
Jones 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
spring 1
something 1
on 1
the 1
people 1
here 1
tonight 1
but 1
I 1
overheard 1
him 1
tell 1
auntie 1
today 1
about 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
secret 1
but 1
I 1
reckon 1
it 1
s 1
not 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
secret 1
now 1
Everybody 1
knows 1
the 1
widow 1
too 1
for 1
all 1
she 1
tries 1
to 1
let 1
on 1
she 1

t 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
was 1
bound 1
Huck 1

About 1
Huck 1
tracking 1
the 1
robbers 1
to 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
I 1
reckon 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
grand 1
time 1
over 1
his 1
surprise 1
but 1
I 1
bet 1
you 1
it 1
will 1
drop 1
pretty 1
flat 1
Sid 1
chuckled 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
contented 1
and 1
satisfied 1
way 1
Sid 1
was 1
it 1
you 1
that 1
told 1
Oh 1
never 1
mind 1
who 1
it 1
was 1
Somebody 1
told 1
that 1
s 1
enough 1
Sid 1
there 1
s 1
only 1
one 1
person 1
in 1
this 1
town 1
mean 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
and 1
that 1
s 1
you 1
If 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
Huck 1
s 1
place 1
you 1
d 1
a 1
sneaked 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
and 1
never 1
told 1
anybody 1
on 1
the 1
robbers 1
You 1
can 1
t 1
do 1
any 1
but 1
mean 1
things 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
t 1
bear 1
to 1
see 1
anybody 1
praised 1
for 1
doing 1
good 1
ones 1
There 1
no 1
thanks 1
as 1
the 1
widow 1
says 1
and 1
Tom 1
cuffed 1
Sid 1
s 1
ears 1
and 1
helped 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
with 1
several 1
kicks 1
Now 1
go 1
and 1
tell 1
auntie 1
if 1
you 1
dare 1
and 1
tomorrow 1
you 1
ll 1
catch 1
it 1
Some 1
minutes 1
later 1
the 1
widow 1
s 1
guests 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
supper 1
table 1
and 1
a 1
dozen 1
children 1
were 1
propped 1
up 1
at 1
little 1
side 1
tables 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
room 1
after 1
the 1
fashion 1
of 1
that 1
country 1
and 1
that 1
day 1
At 1
the 1
proper 1
time 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
made 1
his 1
little 1
speech 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
thanked 1
the 1
widow 1
for 1
the 1
honor 1
she 1
was 1
doing 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
sons 1
but 1
said 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
another 1
person 1
whose 1
modesty 1
And 1
so 1
forth 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
He 1
sprung 1
his 1
secret 1
about 1
Huck 1
s 1
share 1
in 1
the 1
adventure 1
in 1
the 1
finest 1
dramatic 1
manner 1
he 1
was 1
master 1
of 1
but 1
the 1
surprise 1
it 1
occasioned 1
was 1
largely 1
counterfeit 1
and 1
not 1
as 1
clamorous 1
and 1
effusive 1
as 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
under 1
happier 1
circumstances 1
However 1
the 1
widow 1
made 1
a 1
pretty 1
fair 1
show 1
of 1
astonishment 1
and 1
heaped 1
so 1
many 1
compliments 1
and 1
so 1
much 1
gratitude 1
upon 1
Huck 1
that 1
he 1
almost 1
forgot 1
the 1
nearly 1
intolerable 1
discomfort 1
of 1
his 1
new 1
clothes 1
in 1
the 1
entirely 1
intolerable 1
discomfort 1
of 1
being 1
set 1
up 1
as 1
a 1
target 1
for 1
everybody 1
s 1
gaze 1
and 1
everybody 1
s 1
laudations 1
The 1
widow 1
said 1
she 1
meant 1
to 1
give 1
Huck 1
a 1
home 1
under 1
her 1
roof 1
and 1
have 1
him 1
educated 1
and 1
that 1
when 1
she 1
could 1
spare 1
the 1
money 1
she 1
would 1
start 1
him 1
in 1
business 1
in 1
a 1
modest 1
way 1
Tom 1
s 1
chance 1
was 1
come 1
He 1
said 1
Huck 1
don 1
t 1
need 1
it 1
Huck 1
s 1
rich 1
Nothing 1
but 1
a 1
heavy 1
strain 1
upon 1
the 1
good 1
manners 1
of 1
the 1
company 1
kept 1
back 1
the 1
due 1
and 1
proper 1
complimentary 1
laugh 1
at 1
this 1
pleasant 1
joke 1
But 1
the 1
silence 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
awkward 1
Tom 1
broke 1
it 1
Huck 1
s 1
got 1
money 1
Maybe 1
you 1
don 1
t 1
believe 1
it 1
but 1
he 1
s 1
got 1
lots 1
of 1
it 1
Oh 1
you 1
needn 1
t 1
smile 1
I 1
reckon 1
I 1
can 1
show 1
you 1
You 1
just 1
wait 1
a 1
minute 1
Tom 1
ran 1
out 1
of 1
doors 1
The 1
company 1
looked 1
at 1
each 1
other 1
with 1
a 1
perplexed 1
interest 1
and 1
inquiringly 1
at 1
Huck 1
who 1
was 1
tongue 1
tied 1
Sid 1
what 1
ails 1
Tom 1
said 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
He 1
well 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
ever 1
any 1
making 1
of 1
that 1
boy 1
out 1
I 1
never 1
Tom 1
entered 1
struggling 1
with 1
the 1
weight 1
of 1
his 1
sacks 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
did 1
not 1
finish 1
her 1
sentence 1
Tom 1
poured 1
the 1
mass 1
of 1
yellow 1
coin 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
said 1
There 1
what 1
did 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
Half 1
of 1
it 1
s 1
Huck 1
s 1
and 1
half 1
of 1
it 1
s 1
mine 1
The 1
spectacle 1
took 1
the 1
general 1
breath 1
away 1
All 1
gazed 1
nobody 1
spoke 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
Then 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
unanimous 1
call 1
for 1
an 1
explanation 1
Tom 1
said 1
he 1
could 1
furnish 1
it 1
and 1
he 1
did 1
The 1
tale 1
was 1
long 1
but 1
brimful 1
of 1
interest 1
There 1
was 1
scarcely 1
an 1
interruption 1
from 1
any 1
one 1
to 1
break 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
its 1
flow 1
When 1
he 1
had 1
finished 1
Mr 1
Jones 1
said 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
had 1
fixed 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
surprise 1
for 1
this 1
occasion 1
but 1
it 1
don 1
t 1
amount 1
to 1
anything 1
now 1
This 1
one 1
makes 1
it 1
sing 1
mighty 1
small 1
I 1
m 1
willing 1
to 1
allow 1
The 1
money 1
was 1
counted 1
The 1
sum 1
amounted 1
to 1
a 1
little 1
over 1
twelve 1
thousand 1
dollars 1
It 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
any 1
one 1
present 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
at 1
one 1
time 1
before 1
though 1
several 1
persons 1
were 1
there 1
who 1
were 1
worth 1
considerably 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
in 1
property 1
CHAPTER 1
XXXV 1
THE 1
reader 1
may 1
rest 1
satisfied 1
that 1
Tom 1
s 1
and 1
Huck 1
s 1
windfall 1
made 1
a 1
mighty 1
stir 1
in 1
the 1
poor 1
little 1
village 1
of 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
So 1
vast 1
a 1
sum 1
all 1
in 1
actual 1
cash 1
seemed 1
next 1
to 1
incredible 1
It 1
was 1
talked 1
about 1
gloated 1
over 1
glorified 1
until 1
the 1
reason 1
of 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
citizens 1
tottered 1
under 1
the 1
strain 1
of 1
the 1
unhealthy 1
excitement 1
Every 1
haunted 1
house 1
in 1
St 1
Petersburg 1
and 1
the 1
neighboring 1
villages 1
was 1
dissected 1
plank 1
by 1
plank 1
and 1
its 1
foundations 1
dug 1
up 1
and 1
ransacked 1
for 1
hidden 1
treasure 1
and 1
not 1
by 1
boys 1
but 1
men 1
pretty 1
grave 1
unromantic 1
men 1
too 1
some 1
of 1
them 1
Wherever 1
Tom 1
and 1
Huck 1
appeared 1
they 1
were 1
courted 1
admired 1
stared 1
at 1
The 1
boys 1
were 1
not 1
able 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
their 1
remarks 1
had 1
possessed 1
weight 1
before 1
but 1
now 1
their 1
sayings 1
were 1
treasured 1
and 1
repeated 1
everything 1
they 1
did 1
seemed 1
somehow 1
to 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
remarkable 1
they 1
had 1
evidently 1
lost 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
doing 1
and 1
saying 1
commonplace 1
things 1
moreover 1
their 1
past 1
history 1
was 1
raked 1
up 1
and 1
discovered 1
to 1
bear 1
marks 1
of 1
conspicuous 1
originality 1
The 1
village 1
paper 1
published 1
biographical 1
sketches 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
The 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
put 1
Huck 1
s 1
money 1
out 1
at 1
six 1
per 1
cent 1
and 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
with 1
Tom 1
s 1
at 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
s 1
request 1
Each 1
lad 1
had 1
an 1
income 1
now 1
that 1
was 1
simply 1
prodigious 1
a 1
dollar 1
for 1
every 1
weekday 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
and 1
half 1
of 1
the 1
Sundays 1
It 1
was 1
just 1
what 1
the 1
minister 1
got 1
no 1
it 1
was 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
promised 1
he 1
generally 1
couldn 1
t 1
collect 1
it 1
A 1
dollar 1
and 1
a 1
quarter 1
a 1
week 1
would 1
board 1
lodge 1
and 1
school 1
a 1
boy 1
in 1
those 1
old 1
simple 1
days 1
and 1
clothe 1
him 1
and 1
wash 1
him 1
too 1
for 1
that 1
matter 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
had 1
conceived 1
a 1
great 1
opinion 1
of 1
Tom 1
He 1
said 1
that 1
no 1
commonplace 1
boy 1
would 1
ever 1
have 1
got 1
his 1
daughter 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
When 1
Becky 1
told 1
her 1
father 1
in 1
strict 1
confidence 1
how 1
Tom 1
had 1
taken 1
her 1
whipping 1
at 1
school 1
the 1
Judge 1
was 1
visibly 1
moved 1
and 1
when 1
she 1
pleaded 1
grace 1
for 1
the 1
mighty 1
lie 1
which 1
Tom 1
had 1
told 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
shift 1
that 1
whipping 1
from 1
her 1
shoulders 1
to 1
his 1
own 1
the 1
Judge 1
said 1
with 1
a 1
fine 1
outburst 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
noble 1
a 1
generous 1
a 1
magnanimous 1
lie 1
a 1
lie 1
that 1
was 1
worthy 1
to 1
hold 1
up 1
its 1
head 1
and 1
march 1
down 1
through 1
history 1
breast 1
to 1
breast 1
with 1
George 1
Washington 1
s 1
lauded 1
Truth 1
about 1
the 1
hatchet 1
Becky 1
thought 1
her 1
father 1
had 1
never 1
looked 1
so 1
tall 1
and 1
so 1
superb 1
as 1
when 1
he 1
walked 1
the 1
floor 1
and 1
stamped 1
his 1
foot 1
and 1
said 1
that 1
She 1
went 1
straight 1
off 1
and 1
told 1
Tom 1
about 1
it 1
Judge 1
Thatcher 1
hoped 1
to 1
see 1
Tom 1
a 1
great 1
lawyer 1
or 1
a 1
great 1
soldier 1
some 1
day 1
He 1
said 1
he 1
meant 1
to 1
look 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
Tom 1
should 1
be 1
admitted 1
to 1
the 1
National 1
Military 1
Academy 1
and 1
afterward 1
trained 1
in 1
the 1
best 1
law 1
school 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
ready 1
for 1
either 1
career 1
or 1
both 1
Huck 1
Finn 1
s 1
wealth 1
and 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
now 1
under 1
the 1
Widow 1
Douglas 1
protection 1
introduced 1
him 1
into 1
society 1
no 1
dragged 1
him 1
into 1
it 1
hurled 1
him 1
into 1
it 1
and 1
his 1
sufferings 1
were 1
almost 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
could 1
bear 1
The 1
widow 1
s 1
servants 1
kept 1
him 1
clean 1
and 1
neat 1
combed 1
and 1
brushed 1
and 1
they 1
bedded 1
him 1
nightly 1
in 1
unsympathetic 1
sheets 1
that 1
had 1
not 1
one 1
little 1
spot 1
or 1
stain 1
which 1
he 1
could 1
press 1
to 1
his 1
heart 1
and 1
know 1
for 1
a 1
friend 1
He 1
had 1
to 1
eat 1
with 1
a 1
knife 1
and 1
fork 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
use 1
napkin 1
cup 1
and 1
plate 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
learn 1
his 1
book 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
church 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
talk 1
so 1
properly 1
that 1
speech 1
was 1
become 1
insipid 1
in 1
his 1
mouth 1
whithersoever 1
he 1
turned 1
the 1
bars 1
and 1
shackles 1
of 1
civilization 1
shut 1
him 1
in 1
and 1
bound 1
him 1
hand 1
and 1
foot 1
He 1
bravely 1
bore 1
his 1
miseries 1
three 1
weeks 1
and 1
then 1
one 1
day 1
turned 1
up 1
missing 1
For 1
forty 1
eight 1
hours 1
the 1
widow 1
hunted 1
for 1
him 1
everywhere 1
in 1
great 1
distress 1
The 1
public 1
were 1
profoundly 1
concerned 1
they 1
searched 1
high 1

Early 1

Tom 1
Sawyer 1
wisely 1
went 1
poking 1
among 1
some 1
old 1
empty 1
hogsheads 1
down 1
behind 1
the 1
abandoned 1
slaughter 1
house 1
and 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
refugee 1
Huck 1
had 1
slept 1
there 1

had 1
just 1
breakfasted 1
upon 1
some 1
stolen 1
odds 1

of 1
food 1
and 1

his 1
pipe 1
He 1
was 1
unkempt 1
uncombed 1
and 1
clad 1
in 1
the 1

old 1
ruin 1
of 1
rags 1
that 1
had 1
made 1
him 1
picturesque 1
in 1
the 1
days 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
free 1

happy 1
Tom 1
routed 1
him 1
out 1

been 1
causing 1

A 1

is 1
more 1
high 1
toned 1
than 1

In 1

Huck 1

Finally 1

Well 1

It 1

gay 1
Tom 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
Well 1
I 1
bet 1
it 1
is 1
And 1
all 1
that 1
swearing 1
s 1
got 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
at 1
midnight 1
in 1
the 1
lonesomest 1
awfulest 1
place 1
you 1
can 1
find 1
a 1
ha 1
nted 1
house 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
but 1
they 1
re 1

now 1
Well 1

Tom 1
Yes 1

And 1
you 1

got 1
to 1
swear 1
on 1
a 1
coffin 1
and 1
sign 1

Now 1
that 1
s 1
something 1
like 1
Why 1
it 1
s 1
a 1
million 1
times 1
bullier 1
than 1
pirating 1
I 1

ripper 1
of 1
a 1
robber 1
and 1
everybody 1
talking 1

I 1

she 1

snaked 1

CONCLUSION 1
SO 1
endeth 1
this 1
chronicle 1
It 1
being 1
strictly 1
a 1
history 1
of 1
a 1
boy 1
it 1
must 1
stop 1
here 1
the 1
story 1
could 1
not 1
go 1
much 1
further 1
without 1
becoming 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
When 1
one 1
writes 1
a 1
novel 1
about 1
grown 1
people 1
he 1
knows 1
exactly 1
where 1
to 1
stop 1
that 1
is 1
with 1
a 1
marriage 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
writes 1
of 1
juveniles 1
he 1
must 1
stop 1
where 1
he 1
best 1
can 1
Most 1
of 1
the 1
characters 1
that 1
perform 1
in 1
this 1
book 1
still 1
live 1
and 1
are 1
prosperous 1
and 1
happy 1
Some 1
day 1
it 1
may 1
seem 1
worth 1
while 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
younger 1
ones 1
again 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
sort 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
women 1
they 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
therefore 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
wisest 1
not 1
to 1
reveal 1
any 1
of 1
that 1
part 1
of 1
their 1
lives 1
at 1
present 1

I 1
jumped 1
from 1
Well 1
at 1
least 1
said 1
Holmes 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
your 1
revenge 1
upon 1
them 1
There 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
question 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
your 1
oil 1
lamp 1
which 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
crushed 1
in 1
the 1
press 1
set 1
fire 1
to 1
the 1
wooden 1
walls 1
though 1
no 1
doubt 1
they 1
were 1
too 1
excited 1
in 1
the 1
chase 1
after 1
you 1
to 1
observe 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
Now 1
keep 1
your 1
eyes 1
open 1
in 1
this 1
crowd 1
for 1
your 1
friends 1
of 1
last 1
night 1
though 1
I 1
very 1
much 1
fear 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
a 1
good 1
hundred 1
miles 1
off 1
by 1
now 1
And 1
Holmes 1
fears 1
came 1
to 1
be 1
realised 1
for 1
from 1
that 1
day 1
to 1
this 1
no 1
word 1
has 1
ever 1
been 1
heard 1
either 1
of 1
the 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
the 1
sinister 1
German 1
or 1
the 1
morose 1
Englishman 1
Early 1
that 1
morning 1
a 1
peasant 1
had 1
met 1
a 1
cart 1
containing 1
several 1
people 1
and 1
some 1
very 1
bulky 1
boxes 1
driving 1
rapidly 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
Reading 1
but 1
there 1
all 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
fugitives 1
disappeared 1
and 1
even 1
Holmes 1
ingenuity 1
failed 1
ever 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
least 1
clue 1
as 1
to 1
their 1
whereabouts 1
The 1
firemen 1
had 1
been 1
much 1
perturbed 1
at 1
the 1
strange 1
arrangements 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
within 1
and 1
still 1
more 1
so 1
by 1
discovering 1
a 1
newly 1
severed 1
human 1
thumb 1
upon 1
a 1
window 1
sill 1
of 1
the 1
second 1
floor 1
About 1
sunset 1
however 1
their 1
efforts 1
were 1
at 1
last 1
successful 1
and 1
they 1
subdued 1
the 1
flames 1
but 1
not 1
before 1
the 1
roof 1
had 1
fallen 1
in 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1
been 1
reduced 1
to 1
such 1
absolute 1
ruin 1
that 1
save 1
some 1
twisted 1
cylinders 1
and 1
iron 1
piping 1
not 1
a 1
trace 1
remained 1
of 1
the 1
machinery 1
which 1
had 1
cost 1
our 1
unfortunate 1
acquaintance 1
so 1
dearly 1
Large 1
masses 1
of 1
nickel 1
and 1
of 1
tin 1
were 1
discovered 1
stored 1
in 1
an 1
out 1
house 1
but 1
no 1
coins 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
explained 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
those 1
bulky 1
boxes 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
already 1
referred 1
to 1
How 1
our 1
hydraulic 1
engineer 1
had 1
been 1
conveyed 1
from 1
the 1
garden 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
he 1
recovered 1
his 1
senses 1
might 1
have 1
remained 1
forever 1
a 1
mystery 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
soft 1
mould 1
which 1
told 1
us 1
a 1
very 1
plain 1
tale 1
He 1
had 1
evidently 1
been 1
carried 1
down 1
by 1
two 1
persons 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
had 1
remarkably 1
small 1
feet 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
unusually 1
large 1
ones 1
On 1
the 1
whole 1
it 1
was 1
most 1
probable 1
that 1
the 1
silent 1
Englishman 1
being 1
less 1
bold 1
or 1
less 1
murderous 1
than 1
his 1
companion 1
had 1
assisted 1
the 1
woman 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
unconscious 1
man 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
danger 1
Well 1
said 1
our 1
engineer 1
ruefully 1
as 1
we 1
took 1
our 1
seats 1
to 1
return 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
London 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
pretty 1
business 1
for 1
me 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
thumb 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
a 1
fifty 1
guinea 1
fee 1
and 1
what 1
have 1
I 1
gained 1
Experience 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
Indirectly 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
value 1
you 1
know 1
you 1
have 1
only 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
words 1
to 1
gain 1
the 1
reputation 1
of 1
being 1
excellent 1
company 1

more 1
piquant 1
details 1
have 1
drawn 1
the 1
gossips 1
away 1
from 1
this 1
four 1
year 1
old 1
drama 1
As 1
I 1
have 1
reason 1
to 1
believe 1
however 1
that 1
the 1
full 1
facts 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
revealed 1
to 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
and 1
as 1
my 1
friend 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
a 1
considerable 1
share 1
in 1
clearing 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
no 1
memoir 1
of 1
him 1
would 1
be 1
complete 1
without 1
some 1
little 1
sketch 1
of 1
this 1
remarkable 1
episode 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
few 1
weeks 1
before 1
my 1
own 1
marriage 1
during 1
the 1
days 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
still 1
sharing 1
rooms 1
with 1
Holmes 1
in 1
Baker 1
Street 1
that 1
he 1
came 1
home 1
from 1
an 1
afternoon 1
stroll 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
letter 1
on 1
the 1
table 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
I 1
had 1
remained 1
indoors 1
all 1
day 1
for 1
the 1
weather 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
sudden 1
turn 1
to 1
rain 1
with 1
high 1
autumnal 1
winds 1
and 1
the 1
Jezail 1
bullet 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
brought 1
back 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
limbs 1
as 1
a 1
relic 1
of 1
my 1
Afghan 1
campaign 1
throbbed 1
with 1
dull 1
persistence 1
With 1
my 1
body 1
in 1
one 1
easy 1
chair 1
and 1
my 1
legs 1
upon 1
another 1
I 1
had 1
surrounded 1
myself 1
with 1
a 1
cloud 1
of 1
newspapers 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
saturated 1
with 1
the 1
news 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
I 1
tossed 1
them 1
all 1
aside 1
and 1
lay 1
listless 1
watching 1
the 1
huge 1
crest 1
and 1
monogram 1
upon 1
the 1
envelope 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
wondering 1
lazily 1
who 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
noble 1
correspondent 1
could 1
be 1
Here 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
fashionable 1
epistle 1
I 1
remarked 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
Your 1
morning 1
letters 1
if 1
I 1
remember 1
right 1
were 1
from 1
a 1
fish 1
monger 1
and 1
a 1
tide 1
waiter 1
Yes 1
my 1
correspondence 1
has 1
certainly 1
the 1
charm 1
of 1
variety 1
he 1
answered 1
smiling 1
and 1
the 1
humbler 1
are 1
usually 1
the 1
more 1
interesting 1
This 1
looks 1
like 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
unwelcome 1
social 1
summonses 1
which 1
call 1
upon 1
a 1
man 1
either 1
to 1
be 1
bored 1
or 1
to 1
lie 1
He 1
broke 1
the 1
seal 1
and 1
glanced 1
over 1
the 1
contents 1
Oh 1
come 1
it 1
may 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
of 1
interest 1
after 1
all 1
Not 1
social 1
then 1
No 1
distinctly 1
professional 1
And 1
from 1
a 1
noble 1
client 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
in 1
England 1
My 1
dear 1
fellow 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
Watson 1
without 1
affectation 1
that 1
the 1
status 1
of 1
my 1
client 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
less 1
moment 1
to 1
me 1
than 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
his 1
case 1
It 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
however 1
that 1
that 1
also 1
may 1
not 1
be 1
wanting 1
in 1
this 1
new 1
investigation 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
reading 1
the 1
papers 1
diligently 1
of 1
late 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
It 1
looks 1
like 1
it 1
said 1
I 1
ruefully 1
pointing 1
to 1
a 1
huge 1
bundle 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
do 1
It 1
is 1
fortunate 1
for 1
you 1
will 1
perhaps 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
post 1
me 1
up 1
I 1
read 1
nothing 1
except 1
the 1
criminal 1
news 1
and 1
the 1
agony 1
column 1
The 1
latter 1
is 1
always 1
instructive 1
But 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
followed 1
recent 1
events 1
so 1
closely 1
you 1
must 1
have 1
read 1
about 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
and 1
his 1
wedding 1
Oh 1
yes 1
with 1
the 1
deepest 1
interest 1
That 1
is 1
well 1
The 1
letter 1
which 1
I 1
hold 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
is 1
from 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
I 1
will 1
read 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
in 1
return 1
you 1
must 1
turn 1
over 1
these 1
papers 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
whatever 1
bears 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
This 1
is 1
what 1
he 1
says 1
MY 1
DEAR 1
MR 1
SHERLOCK 1
HOLMES 1
Lord 1
Backwater 1
tells 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
place 1
implicit 1
reliance 1
upon 1
your 1
judgment 1
and 1
discretion 1
I 1
have 1
determined 1
therefore 1
to 1
call 1
upon 1
you 1
and 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
in 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
painful 1
event 1
which 1
has 1
occurred 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
my 1
wedding 1
Mr 1
Lestrade 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
is 1
acting 1
already 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
he 1
assures 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
sees 1
no 1
objection 1
to 1
your 1
co 1
operation 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
even 1
thinks 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
of 1
some 1
assistance 1
I 1
will 1
call 1
at 1
four 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon 1
and 1
should 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
other 1
engagement 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
postpone 1
it 1
as 1
this 1
matter 1
is 1
of 1
paramount 1
importance 1
Yours 1
faithfully 1
ST 1
SIMON 1
It 1
is 1
dated 1
from 1
Grosvenor 1
Mansions 1
written 1
with 1
a 1
quill 1
pen 1
and 1
the 1
noble 1
lord 1
has 1
had 1
the 1
misfortune 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
smear 1
of 1
ink 1
upon 1
the 1
outer 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
right 1
little 1
finger 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
as 1
he 1
folded 1
up 1
the 1
epistle 1
He 1
says 1
four 1
o 1
clock 1
It 1
is 1
three 1
now 1
He 1
will 1
be 1
here 1
in 1
an 1
hour 1
Then 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
time 1
with 1
your 1
assistance 1
to 1
get 1
clear 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
Turn 1
over 1
those 1
papers 1
and 1
arrange 1
the 1
extracts 1
in 1
their 1
order 1
of 1
time 1
while 1
I 1
take 1
a 1
glance 1
as 1
to 1
who 1
our 1
client 1
is 1

from 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
books 1
of 1
reference 1
beside 1
the 1
mantelpiece 1
Here 1

is 1

down 1

Ha 1
Well 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
very 1
instructive 1
in 1
all 1
this 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
turn 1
to 1
you 1
Watson 1
for 1
something 1
more 1
solid 1
I 1
have 1
very 1
little 1
difficulty 1
in 1
finding 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
said 1
I 1
for 1
the 1
facts 1
are 1
quite 1
recent 1
and 1
the 1
matter 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
remarkable 1
I 1
feared 1
to 1
refer 1
them 1
to 1
you 1
however 1
as 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
an 1
inquiry 1
on 1
hand 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
disliked 1
the 1
intrusion 1
of 1
other 1
matters 1
Oh 1
you 1
mean 1
the 1
little 1
problem 1
of 1
the 1
Grosvenor 1
Square 1
furniture 1
van 1
That 1
is 1
quite 1
cleared 1
up 1
now 1
though 1
indeed 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
Pray 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
results 1
of 1
your 1
newspaper 1
selections 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
notice 1
which 1
I 1
can 1
find 1
It 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
personal 1
column 1
of 1
the 1
Morning 1
Post 1
and 1
dates 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
some 1
weeks 1
back 1
A 1
marriage 1
has 1
been 1
arranged 1
it 1
says 1
and 1
will 1
if 1
rumour 1
is 1
correct 1
very 1
shortly 1
take 1
place 1
between 1
Lord 1
Robert 1
St 1
Simon 1
second 1
son 1
of 1

Duke 1

That 1
is 1
all 1
Terse 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
stretching 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
legs 1
towards 1
the 1
fire 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
paragraph 1
amplifying 1
this 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
society 1
papers 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
week 1
Ah 1
here 1
it 1
is 1
There 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
a 1
call 1
for 1
protection 1
in 1
the 1
marriage 1
market 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
free 1
trade 1
principle 1
appears 1
to 1
tell 1
heavily 1
against 1
our 1
home 1
product 1
One 1
by 1
one 1
the 1
management 1
of 1
the 1
noble 1
houses 1
of 1
Great 1
Britain 1
is 1
passing 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
our 1
fair 1
cousins 1
from 1
across 1
the 1
Atlantic 1
An 1
important 1
addition 1
has 1
been 1
made 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
week 1
to 1
the 1
list 1
of 1
the 1
prizes 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
borne 1
away 1
by 1
these 1
charming 1
invaders 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
who 1
has 1
shown 1
himself 1
for 1
over 1
twenty 1
years 1
proof 1
against 1
the 1
little 1
god 1
s 1
arrows 1
has 1
now 1
definitely 1
announced 1
his 1
approaching 1
marriage 1
with 1
Miss 1
Hatty 1
Doran 1
the 1
fascinating 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
California 1
millionaire 1
Miss 1
Doran 1
whose 1
graceful 1
figure 1
and 1
striking 1
face 1
attracted 1
much 1
attention 1
at 1
the 1
Westbury 1
House 1
festivities 1
is 1
an 1
only 1
child 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
currently 1
reported 1
that 1
her 1
dowry 1
will 1
run 1
to 1
considerably 1
over 1
the 1
six 1
figures 1
with 1
expectancies 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
As 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
open 1
secret 1
that 1
the 1
Duke 1
of 1
Balmoral 1
has 1
been 1
compelled 1
to 1
sell 1
his 1
pictures 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
years 1
and 1
as 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
has 1
no 1
property 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
save 1
the 1
small 1
estate 1
of 1
Birchmoor 1
it 1
is 1
obvious 1
that 1
the 1
Californian 1
heiress 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
only 1
gainer 1
by 1
an 1
alliance 1
which 1
will 1
enable 1
her 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
easy 1
and 1
common 1
transition 1
from 1
a 1
Republican 1
lady 1
to 1
a 1
British 1
peeress 1
Anything 1
else 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
yawning 1
Oh 1
yes 1
plenty 1
Then 1
there 1
is 1
another 1
note 1
in 1
the 1
Morning 1
Post 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
marriage 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
absolutely 1
quiet 1
one 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
at 1
St 1
George 1
s 1
Hanover 1
Square 1
that 1
only 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
intimate 1
friends 1
would 1
be 1
invited 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
party 1
would 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
furnished 1
house 1
at 1
Lancaster 1
Gate 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
taken 1
by 1
Mr 1
Aloysius 1
Doran 1
Two 1
days 1
later 1
that 1
is 1
on 1
Wednesday 1
last 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
curt 1
announcement 1
that 1
the 1
wedding 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
honeymoon 1
would 1
be 1
passed 1
at 1
Lord 1
Backwater 1
s 1
place 1
near 1
Petersfield 1
Those 1
are 1
all 1
the 1
notices 1
which 1
appeared 1
before 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
Before 1
the 1
what 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
with 1
a 1
start 1
The 1
vanishing 1
of 1
the 1
lady 1
When 1
did 1
she 1
vanish 1
then 1
At 1
the 1
wedding 1
breakfast 1
Indeed 1
This 1
is 1
more 1
interesting 1
than 1
it 1
promised 1
to 1
be 1
quite 1
dramatic 1
in 1
fact 1
Yes 1
it 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
little 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
common 1
They 1
often 1
vanish 1
before 1
the 1
ceremony 1
and 1
occasionally 1
during 1
the 1
honeymoon 1
but 1
I 1
cannot 1
call 1
to 1
mind 1
anything 1
quite 1
so 1
prompt 1
as 1
this 1
Pray 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
the 1
details 1
I 1
warn 1
you 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
very 1
incomplete 1
Perhaps 1
we 1
may 1
make 1
them 1
less 1
so 1
Such 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
they 1
are 1
set 1
forth 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
article 1
of 1
a 1
morning 1
paper 1
of 1
yesterday 1
which 1
I 1
will 1
read 1
to 1
you 1
It 1
is 1
headed 1
Singular 1
Occurrence 1
at 1
a 1
Fashionable 1
Wedding 1
The 1
family 1
of 1
Lord 1
Robert 1
St 1
Simon 1
has 1
been 1
thrown 1
into 1
the 1
greatest 1
consternation 1
by 1
the 1
strange 1
and 1
painful 1
episodes 1
which 1
have 1
taken 1
place 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
his 1
wedding 1
The 1
ceremony 1
as 1
shortly 1
announced 1
in 1
the 1
papers 1
of 1
yesterday 1
occurred 1
on 1
the 1
previous 1
morning 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
now 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
possible 1
to 1
confirm 1
the 1
strange 1
rumours 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
persistently 1
floating 1
about 1
In 1
spite 1
of 1
the 1
attempts 1
of 1
the 1
friends 1
to 1
hush 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
so 1
much 1
public 1
attention 1
has 1
now 1
been 1
drawn 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
no 1
good 1
purpose 1
can 1
be 1
served 1
by 1
affecting 1
to 1
disregard 1
what 1
is 1
a 1
common 1
subject 1
for 1
conversation 1
The 1
ceremony 1
which 1
was 1
performed 1
at 1
St 1
George 1
s 1
Hanover 1
Square 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
quiet 1
one 1
no 1
one 1
being 1
present 1
save 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
Mr 1
Aloysius 1
Doran 1
the 1
Duchess 1
of 1
Balmoral 1
Lord 1
Backwater 1
Lord 1
Eustace 1
and 1
Lady 1
Clara 1
St 1
Simon 1
the 1
younger 1
brother 1
and 1
sister 1
of 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
and 1
Lady 1
Alicia 1
Whittington 1
The 1
whole 1
party 1
proceeded 1
afterwards 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
Mr 1
Aloysius 1
Doran 1
at 1
Lancaster 1
Gate 1
where 1
breakfast 1
had 1
been 1
prepared 1
It 1
appears 1
that 1
some 1
little 1
trouble 1
was 1
caused 1
by 1
a 1
woman 1
whose 1
name 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
ascertained 1
who 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
force 1
her 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
after 1
the 1
bridal 1
party 1
alleging 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
claim 1
upon 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
after 1
a 1
painful 1
and 1
prolonged 1
scene 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
ejected 1
by 1
the 1
butler 1
and 1
the 1
footman 1
The 1
bride 1
who 1
had 1
fortunately 1
entered 1
the 1
house 1
before 1
this 1
unpleasant 1
interruption 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
with 1
the 1
rest 1
when 1
she 1
complained 1
of 1
a 1
sudden 1
indisposition 1
and 1
retired 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
Her 1
prolonged 1
absence 1
having 1
caused 1
some 1
comment 1
her 1
father 1
followed 1
her 1
but 1
learned 1
from 1
her 1
maid 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
only 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
chamber 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
caught 1
up 1
an 1
ulster 1
and 1
bonnet 1
and 1
hurried 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
passage 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
footmen 1
declared 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
a 1
lady 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
thus 1
apparelled 1
but 1
had 1
refused 1
to 1
credit 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
mistress 1
believing 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
the 1
company 1
On 1
ascertaining 1
that 1
his 1
daughter 1
had 1
disappeared 1
Mr 1
Aloysius 1
Doran 1
in 1
conjunction 1
with 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
instantly 1
put 1
themselves 1
in 1
communication 1
with 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
very 1
energetic 1
inquiries 1
are 1
being 1
made 1
which 1
will 1
probably 1
result 1
in 1
a 1
speedy 1
clearing 1
up 1
of 1
this 1
very 1
singular 1
business 1
Up 1
to 1
a 1
late 1
hour 1
last 1
night 1
however 1
nothing 1
had 1
transpired 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
whereabouts 1
of 1
the 1
missing 1
lady 1
There 1
are 1
rumours 1
of 1
foul 1
play 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
police 1
have 1
caused 1
the 1
arrest 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
original 1
disturbance 1
in 1
the 1
belief 1
that 1
from 1
jealousy 1
or 1
some 1
other 1
motive 1
she 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
concerned 1
in 1
the 1
strange 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
And 1
is 1
that 1
all 1
Only 1
one 1
little 1
item 1
in 1
another 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
papers 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
suggestive 1
one 1
And 1
it 1
is 1
That 1
Miss 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
had 1
caused 1
the 1
disturbance 1
has 1
actually 1
been 1
arrested 1
It 1
appears 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
formerly 1
a 1
danseuse 1
at 1
the 1
Allegro 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
known 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
There 1
are 1
no 1
further 1
particulars 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
case 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
hands 1
now 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
set 1
forth 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
press 1
And 1
an 1
exceedingly 1
interesting 1
case 1
it 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
missed 1
it 1
for 1
worlds 1
But 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
ring 1
at 1
the 1
bell 1
Watson 1
and 1
as 1
the 1
clock 1
makes 1
it 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
after 1
four 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
this 1
will 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
our 1
noble 1
client 1
Do 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
going 1
Watson 1
for 1
I 1
very 1
much 1
prefer 1
having 1
a 1
witness 1
if 1
only 1
as 1
a 1
check 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
memory 1
Lord 1
Robert 1
St 1
Simon 1
announced 1
our 1
page 1
boy 1
throwing 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
A 1
gentleman 1
entered 1
with 1
a 1
pleasant 1
cultured 1
face 1
high 1
nosed 1
and 1
pale 1
with 1
something 1
perhaps 1
of 1
petulance 1
about 1
the 1
mouth 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
steady 1
well 1
opened 1
eye 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
pleasant 1
lot 1
it 1
had 1
ever 1
been 1
to 1
command 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
obeyed 1
His 1
manner 1
was 1
brisk 1
and 1
yet 1
his 1
general 1
appearance 1
gave 1
an 1
undue 1
impression 1
of 1
age 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
slight 1
forward 1
stoop 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
bend 1
of 1
the 1
knees 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
His 1
hair 1
too 1
as 1
he 1
swept 1
off 1
his 1
very 1
curly 1
brimmed 1
hat 1
was 1
grizzled 1
round 1
the 1
edges 1
and 1
thin 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
As 1
to 1
his 1
dress 1
it 1
was 1
careful 1
to 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
foppishness 1
with 1
high 1
collar 1
black 1
frock 1
coat 1
white 1
waistcoat 1
yellow 1
gloves 1
patent 1
leather 1
shoes 1
and 1
light 1
coloured 1
gaiters 1
He 1
advanced 1
slowly 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
turning 1
his 1
head 1
from 1
left 1
to 1
right 1
and 1
swinging 1
in 1
his 1
right 1
hand 1
the 1
cord 1
which 1
held 1
his 1
golden 1
eyeglasses 1
Good 1
day 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
said 1
Holmes 1
rising 1
and 1
bowing 1
Pray 1
take 1
the 1
basket 1
chair 1
This 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
colleague 1
Dr 1
Watson 1
Draw 1
up 1
a 1
little 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
talk 1
this 1
matter 1
over 1
A 1
most 1
painful 1
matter 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
you 1
can 1
most 1
readily 1
imagine 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
cut 1
to 1
the 1
quick 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
managed 1
several 1
delicate 1
cases 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
sir 1
though 1
I 1
presume 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
hardly 1
from 1
the 1
same 1
class 1
of 1
society 1
No 1
I 1
am 1
descending 1
I 1
beg 1
pardon 1
My 1
last 1
client 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
was 1
a 1
king 1
Oh 1
really 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
And 1
which 1
king 1
The 1
King 1
of 1
Scandinavia 1
What 1
Had 1
he 1
lost 1
his 1
wife 1
You 1
can 1
understand 1
said 1
Holmes 1
suavely 1
that 1
I 1
extend 1
to 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
my 1
other 1
clients 1
the 1
same 1
secrecy 1
which 1
I 1
promise 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
yours 1
Of 1
course 1
Very 1
right 1
very 1
right 1
I 1
m 1
sure 1
I 1
beg 1
pardon 1
As 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
case 1
I 1
am 1
ready 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
any 1
information 1
which 1
may 1
assist 1
you 1
in 1
forming 1
an 1
opinion 1
Thank 1
you 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
learned 1
all 1
that 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
prints 1
nothing 1
more 1
I 1
presume 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
take 1
it 1
as 1
correct 1
this 1
article 1
for 1
example 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
the 1
bride 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
glanced 1
over 1
it 1
Yes 1
it 1
is 1
correct 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
it 1
goes 1
But 1
it 1
needs 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
supplementing 1
before 1
anyone 1
could 1
offer 1
an 1
opinion 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
arrive 1
at 1
my 1
facts 1
most 1
directly 1
by 1
questioning 1
you 1
Pray 1
do 1
so 1
When 1
did 1
you 1
first 1
meet 1
Miss 1
Hatty 1
Doran 1
In 1
San 1
Francisco 1
a 1
year 1
ago 1
You 1
were 1
travelling 1
in 1
the 1
States 1
Yes 1
Did 1
you 1
become 1
engaged 1
then 1
No 1
But 1
you 1
were 1
on 1
a 1
friendly 1
footing 1
I 1
was 1
amused 1
by 1
her 1
society 1
and 1
she 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
amused 1
Her 1
father 1
is 1
very 1
rich 1
He 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
richest 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
Pacific 1
slope 1
And 1
how 1
did 1
he 1
make 1
his 1
money 1
In 1
mining 1
He 1
had 1
nothing 1
a 1
few 1
years 1
ago 1
Then 1
he 1
struck 1
gold 1
invested 1
it 1
and 1
came 1
up 1
by 1
leaps 1
and 1
bounds 1
Now 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
impression 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
s 1
your 1
wife 1
s 1
character 1
The 1
nobleman 1
swung 1
his 1
glasses 1
a 1
little 1
faster 1
and 1
stared 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
You 1
see 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
said 1
he 1
my 1
wife 1
was 1
twenty 1
before 1
her 1
father 1
became 1
a 1
rich 1
man 1
During 1
that 1
time 1
she 1
ran 1
free 1
in 1
a 1
mining 1
camp 1
and 1
wandered 1
through 1
woods 1
or 1
mountains 1
so 1
that 1
her 1
education 1
has 1
come 1
from 1
Nature 1
rather 1
than 1
from 1
the 1
schoolmaster 1
She 1
is 1
what 1
we 1
call 1
in 1
England 1
a 1
tomboy 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
nature 1
wild 1
and 1
free 1
unfettered 1
by 1
any 1
sort 1
of 1
traditions 1
She 1
is 1
impetuous 1
volcanic 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
say 1
She 1
is 1
swift 1
in 1
making 1
up 1
her 1
mind 1
and 1
fearless 1
in 1
carrying 1
out 1
her 1
resolutions 1
On 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
given 1
her 1
the 1
name 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
bear 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
little 1
stately 1
cough 1
had 1
not 1
I 1
thought 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
bottom 1
a 1
noble 1
woman 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
capable 1
of 1
heroic 1
self 1
sacrifice 1
and 1
that 1
anything 1
dishonourable 1
would 1
be 1
repugnant 1
to 1
her 1
Have 1
you 1
her 1
photograph 1
I 1
brought 1
this 1
with 1
me 1
He 1
opened 1
a 1
locket 1
and 1
showed 1
us 1
the 1
full 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
lovely 1
woman 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
photograph 1
but 1
an 1
ivory 1
miniature 1
and 1
the 1
artist 1
had 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
full 1
effect 1
of 1
the 1
lustrous 1
black 1
hair 1
the 1
large 1
dark 1
eyes 1
and 1
the 1
exquisite 1
mouth 1
Holmes 1
gazed 1
long 1
and 1
earnestly 1
at 1
it 1
Then 1
he 1
closed 1
the 1
locket 1
and 1
handed 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
The 1
young 1
lady 1
came 1
to 1
London 1
then 1
and 1
you 1
renewed 1
your 1
acquaintance 1
Yes 1
her 1
father 1
brought 1
her 1
over 1
for 1
this 1
last 1
London 1
season 1
I 1
met 1
her 1
several 1
times 1
became 1
engaged 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
have 1
now 1
married 1
her 1
She 1
brought 1
I 1
understand 1
a 1
considerable 1
dowry 1
A 1
fair 1
dowry 1
Not 1
more 1
than 1
is 1
usual 1
in 1
my 1
family 1
And 1
this 1
of 1
course 1
remains 1
to 1
you 1
since 1
the 1
marriage 1
is 1
a 1
fait 1
accompli 1
I 1
really 1
have 1
made 1
no 1
inquiries 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
Very 1
naturally 1
not 1
Did 1
you 1
see 1
Miss 1
Doran 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
the 1
wedding 1
Yes 1
Was 1
she 1
in 1
good 1
spirits 1
Never 1
better 1
She 1
kept 1
talking 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
in 1
our 1
future 1
lives 1
Indeed 1
That 1
is 1
very 1
interesting 1
And 1
on 1
the 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
wedding 1
She 1
was 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
possible 1
at 1
least 1
until 1
after 1
the 1
ceremony 1
And 1
did 1
you 1
observe 1
any 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
then 1
Well 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
I 1
saw 1
then 1
the 1
first 1
signs 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
ever 1
seen 1
that 1
her 1
temper 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
sharp 1
The 1
incident 1
however 1
was 1
too 1
trivial 1
to 1
relate 1
and 1
can 1
have 1
no 1
possible 1
bearing 1
upon 1
the 1
case 1
Pray 1
let 1
us 1
have 1
it 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
Oh 1
it 1
is 1
childish 1
She 1
dropped 1
her 1
bouquet 1
as 1
we 1
went 1
towards 1
the 1
vestry 1
She 1
was 1
passing 1
the 1
front 1
pew 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
over 1
into 1
the 1
pew 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
moment 1
s 1
delay 1
but 1
the 1
gentleman 1
in 1
the 1
pew 1
handed 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
again 1
and 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
appear 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
the 1
fall 1
Yet 1
when 1
I 1
spoke 1
to 1
her 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
she 1
answered 1
me 1
abruptly 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
carriage 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
home 1
she 1
seemed 1
absurdly 1
agitated 1
over 1
this 1
trifling 1
cause 1
Indeed 1
You 1
say 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
gentleman 1
in 1
the 1
pew 1
Some 1
of 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
were 1
present 1
then 1
Oh 1
yes 1
It 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
exclude 1
them 1
when 1
the 1
church 1
is 1
open 1
This 1
gentleman 1
was 1
not 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
wife 1
s 1
friends 1
No 1
no 1
I 1
call 1
him 1
a 1
gentleman 1
by 1
courtesy 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
common 1
looking 1
person 1
I 1
hardly 1
noticed 1
his 1
appearance 1
But 1
really 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
wandering 1
rather 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
point 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
then 1
returned 1
from 1
the 1
wedding 1
in 1
a 1
less 1
cheerful 1
frame 1
of 1
mind 1
than 1
she 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
it 1
What 1
did 1
she 1
do 1
on 1
re 1
entering 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
house 1
I 1
saw 1
her 1
in 1
conversation 1
with 1
her 1
maid 1
And 1
who 1
is 1
her 1
maid 1
Alice 1
is 1
her 1
name 1
She 1
is 1
an 1
American 1
and 1
came 1
from 1
California 1
with 1
her 1
A 1
confidential 1
servant 1
A 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
so 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
her 1
mistress 1
allowed 1
her 1
to 1
take 1
great 1
liberties 1
Still 1
of 1
course 1
in 1
America 1
they 1
look 1
upon 1
these 1
things 1
in 1
a 1
different 1
way 1
How 1
long 1
did 1
she 1
speak 1
to 1
this 1
Alice 1
Oh 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
I 1
had 1
something 1
else 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
You 1
did 1
not 1
overhear 1
what 1
they 1
said 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
said 1
something 1
about 1
jumping 1
a 1
claim 1
She 1
was 1
accustomed 1
to 1
use 1
slang 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
what 1
she 1
meant 1
American 1
slang 1
is 1
very 1
expressive 1
sometimes 1
And 1
what 1
did 1
your 1
wife 1
do 1
when 1
she 1
finished 1
speaking 1
to 1
her 1
maid 1
She 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
breakfast 1
room 1
On 1
your 1
arm 1
No 1
alone 1
She 1
was 1
very 1
independent 1
in 1
little 1
matters 1
like 1
that 1
Then 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
sat 1
down 1
for 1
ten 1
minutes 1
or 1
so 1
she 1
rose 1
hurriedly 1
muttered 1
some 1
words 1
of 1
apology 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
She 1
never 1
came 1
back 1
But 1
this 1
maid 1
Alice 1
as 1
I 1
understand 1
deposes 1
that 1
she 1
went 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
covered 1
her 1
bride 1
s 1
dress 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
ulster 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
bonnet 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
Quite 1
so 1
And 1
she 1
was 1
afterwards 1
seen 1
walking 1
into 1
Hyde 1
Park 1
in 1
company 1
with 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
in 1
custody 1
and 1
who 1
had 1
already 1
made 1
a 1
disturbance 1
at 1
Mr 1
Doran 1
s 1
house 1
that 1
morning 1
Ah 1
yes 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
a 1
few 1
particulars 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
young 1
lady 1
and 1
your 1
relations 1
to 1
her 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
raised 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
We 1
have 1
been 1
on 1
a 1
friendly 1
footing 1
for 1
some 1
years 1
I 1
may 1
say 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
friendly 1
footing 1
She 1
used 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
Allegro 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
treated 1
her 1
ungenerously 1
and 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
just 1
cause 1
of 1
complaint 1
against 1
me 1
but 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
women 1
are 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Flora 1
was 1
a 1
dear 1
little 1
thing 1
but 1
exceedingly 1
hot 1
headed 1
and 1
devotedly 1
attached 1
to 1
me 1
She 1
wrote 1
me 1
dreadful 1
letters 1
when 1
she 1
heard 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
married 1
and 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
I 1
had 1
the 1
marriage 1
celebrated 1
so 1
quietly 1
was 1
that 1
I 1
feared 1
lest 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
scandal 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
She 1
came 1
to 1
Mr 1
Doran 1
s 1
door 1
just 1
after 1
we 1
returned 1
and 1
she 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
push 1
her 1
way 1
in 1
uttering 1
very 1
abusive 1
expressions 1
towards 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
even 1
threatening 1
her 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
foreseen 1
the 1
possibility 1
of 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
two 1
police 1
fellows 1
there 1
in 1
private 1
clothes 1
who 1
soon 1
pushed 1
her 1
out 1
again 1
She 1
was 1
quiet 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
good 1
in 1
making 1
a 1
row 1
Did 1
your 1
wife 1
hear 1
all 1
this 1
No 1
thank 1
goodness 1
she 1
did 1
not 1
And 1
she 1
was 1
seen 1
walking 1
with 1
this 1
very 1
woman 1
afterwards 1
Yes 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
Mr 1
Lestrade 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
looks 1
upon 1
as 1
so 1
serious 1
It 1
is 1
thought 1
that 1
Flora 1
decoyed 1
my 1
wife 1
out 1
and 1
laid 1
some 1
terrible 1
trap 1
for 1
her 1
Well 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
possible 1
supposition 1
You 1
think 1
so 1
too 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
probable 1
one 1
But 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
yourself 1
look 1
upon 1
this 1
as 1
likely 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
Flora 1
would 1
hurt 1
a 1
fly 1
Still 1
jealousy 1
is 1
a 1
strange 1
transformer 1
of 1
characters 1
Pray 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
own 1
theory 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
took 1
place 1
Well 1
really 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
seek 1
a 1
theory 1
not 1
to 1
propound 1
one 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
Since 1
you 1
ask 1
me 1
however 1
I 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
occurred 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
possible 1
that 1
the 1
excitement 1
of 1
this 1
affair 1
the 1
consciousness 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
made 1
so 1
immense 1
a 1
social 1
stride 1
had 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
causing 1
some 1
little 1
nervous 1
disturbance 1
in 1
my 1
wife 1
In 1
short 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
become 1
suddenly 1
deranged 1
Well 1
really 1
when 1
I 1
consider 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
turned 1
her 1
back 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
say 1
upon 1
me 1
but 1
upon 1
so 1
much 1
that 1
many 1
have 1
aspired 1
to 1
without 1
success 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
explain 1
it 1
in 1
any 1
other 1
fashion 1
Well 1
certainly 1
that 1
is 1
also 1
a 1
conceivable 1
hypothesis 1
said 1
Holmes 1
smiling 1
And 1
now 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
nearly 1
all 1
my 1
data 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
whether 1
you 1
were 1
seated 1
at 1
the 1
breakfast 1
table 1
so 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
We 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
the 1
Park 1
Quite 1
so 1
Then 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
need 1
to 1
detain 1
you 1
longer 1
I 1
shall 1
communicate 1
with 1
you 1
Should 1
you 1
be 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
solve 1
this 1
problem 1
said 1
our 1
client 1
rising 1
I 1
have 1
solved 1
it 1
Eh 1
What 1
was 1
that 1
I 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
solved 1
it 1
Where 1
then 1
is 1
my 1
wife 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
detail 1
which 1
I 1
shall 1
speedily 1
supply 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
it 1
will 1
take 1
wiser 1
heads 1
than 1
yours 1
or 1
mine 1
he 1
remarked 1
and 1
bowing 1
in 1
a 1
stately 1
old 1
fashioned 1
manner 1
he 1
departed 1
It 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
of 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
to 1
honour 1
my 1
head 1
by 1
putting 1
it 1
on 1
a 1
level 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
whisky 1
and 1
soda 1
and 1
a 1
cigar 1
after 1
all 1
this 1
cross 1
questioning 1
I 1
had 1
formed 1
my 1
conclusions 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
case 1
before 1
our 1
client 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
My 1
dear 1
Holmes 1
I 1
have 1
notes 1
of 1
several 1
similar 1
cases 1
though 1
none 1
as 1
I 1
remarked 1
before 1
which 1
were 1
quite 1
as 1
prompt 1
My 1
whole 1
examination 1
served 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
conjecture 1
into 1
a 1
certainty 1
Circumstantial 1
evidence 1
is 1
occasionally 1
very 1
convincing 1
as 1
when 1
you 1
find 1
a 1
trout 1
in 1
the 1
milk 1
to 1
quote 1
Thoreau 1
s 1
example 1
But 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
Without 1
however 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
pre 1
existing 1
cases 1
which 1
serves 1
me 1
so 1
well 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
parallel 1
instance 1
in 1
Aberdeen 1
some 1
years 1
back 1
and 1
something 1
on 1
very 1
much 1
the 1
same 1
lines 1
at 1
Munich 1
the 1
year 1
after 1
the 1
Franco 1
Prussian 1
War 1
It 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
cases 1
but 1
hullo 1
here 1
is 1
Lestrade 1
Good 1
afternoon 1
Lestrade 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
an 1
extra 1
tumbler 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
cigars 1
in 1
the 1
box 1
The 1
official 1
detective 1
was 1
attired 1
in 1
a 1
pea 1
jacket 1
and 1
cravat 1
which 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
decidedly 1
nautical 1
appearance 1
and 1
he 1
carried 1
a 1
black 1
canvas 1
bag 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
With 1
a 1
short 1
greeting 1
he 1
seated 1
himself 1
and 1
lit 1
the 1
cigar 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
offered 1
to 1
him 1
What 1
s 1
up 1
then 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
with 1
a 1
twinkle 1
in 1
his 1
eye 1
You 1
look 1
dissatisfied 1
And 1
I 1
feel 1
dissatisfied 1
It 1
is 1
this 1
infernal 1
St 1
Simon 1
marriage 1
case 1
I 1
can 1
make 1
neither 1
head 1
nor 1
tail 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
Really 1
You 1
surprise 1
me 1
Who 1
ever 1
heard 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
mixed 1
affair 1
Every 1
clue 1
seems 1
to 1
slip 1
through 1
my 1
fingers 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
work 1
upon 1
it 1
all 1
day 1
And 1
very 1
wet 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
made 1
you 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laying 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
arm 1
of 1
the 1
pea 1
jacket 1
Yes 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
dragging 1
the 1
Serpentine 1
In 1
heaven 1
s 1
name 1
what 1
for 1
In 1
search 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
laughed 1
heartily 1
Have 1
you 1
dragged 1
the 1
basin 1
of 1
Trafalgar 1
Square 1
fountain 1
he 1
asked 1
Why 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
Because 1
you 1
have 1
just 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
finding 1
this 1
lady 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
Lestrade 1
shot 1
an 1
angry 1
glance 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
I 1
suppose 1
you 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
he 1
snarled 1
Well 1
I 1
have 1
only 1
just 1
heard 1
the 1
facts 1
but 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
Oh 1
indeed 1
Then 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
Serpentine 1
plays 1
no 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
think 1
it 1
very 1
unlikely 1
Then 1
perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
kindly 1
explain 1
how 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
we 1
found 1
this 1
in 1
it 1
He 1
opened 1
his 1
bag 1
as 1
he 1
spoke 1
and 1
tumbled 1
onto 1
the 1
floor 1
a 1
wedding 1
dress 1
of 1
watered 1
silk 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
white 1
satin 1
shoes 1
and 1
a 1
bride 1
s 1
wreath 1
and 1
veil 1
all 1
discoloured 1
and 1
soaked 1
in 1
water 1
There 1
said 1
he 1
putting 1
a 1
new 1
wedding 1
ring 1
upon 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
pile 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
nut 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
crack 1
Master 1
Holmes 1
Oh 1
indeed 1
said 1
my 1
friend 1
blowing 1
blue 1
rings 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
You 1
dragged 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
Serpentine 1
No 1
They 1
were 1
found 1
floating 1
near 1
the 1
margin 1
by 1
a 1
park 1
keeper 1
They 1
have 1
been 1
identified 1
as 1
her 1
clothes 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
clothes 1
were 1
there 1
the 1
body 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
far 1
off 1
By 1
the 1
same 1
brilliant 1
reasoning 1
every 1
man 1
s 1
body 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
his 1
wardrobe 1
And 1
pray 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
hope 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
through 1
this 1
At 1
some 1
evidence 1
implicating 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
in 1
the 1
disappearance 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
difficult 1
Are 1
you 1
indeed 1
now 1
cried 1
Lestrade 1
with 1
some 1
bitterness 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
Holmes 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
practical 1
with 1
your 1
deductions 1
and 1
your 1
inferences 1
You 1
have 1
made 1
two 1
blunders 1
in 1
as 1
many 1
minutes 1
This 1
dress 1
does 1
implicate 1
Miss 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
And 1
how 1
In 1
the 1
dress 1
is 1
a 1
pocket 1
In 1
the 1
pocket 1
is 1
a 1
card 1
case 1
In 1
the 1
card 1
case 1
is 1
a 1
note 1
And 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
note 1
He 1
slapped 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him 1
Listen 1
to 1
this 1
You 1
will 1
see 1
me 1
when 1
all 1
is 1
ready 1
Come 1
at 1
once 1
F 1
H 1
M 1
Now 1
my 1
theory 1
all 1
along 1
has 1
been 1
that 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
was 1
decoyed 1
away 1
by 1
Flora 1
Millar 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
with 1
confederates 1
no 1
doubt 1
was 1
responsible 1
for 1
her 1
disappearance 1
Here 1
signed 1
with 1
her 1
initials 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
note 1
which 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
quietly 1
slipped 1
into 1
her 1
hand 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
which 1
lured 1
her 1
within 1
their 1
reach 1
Very 1
good 1
Lestrade 1
said 1
Holmes 1
laughing 1
You 1
really 1
are 1
very 1
fine 1
indeed 1
Let 1
me 1
see 1
it 1
He 1
took 1
up 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
a 1
listless 1
way 1
but 1
his 1
attention 1
instantly 1
became 1
riveted 1
and 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
satisfaction 1
This 1
is 1
indeed 1
important 1
said 1
he 1
Ha 1
you 1
find 1
it 1
so 1
Extremely 1
so 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
warmly 1
Lestrade 1
rose 1
in 1
his 1
triumph 1
and 1
bent 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
look 1
Why 1
he 1
shrieked 1
you 1
re 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
wrong 1
side 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
The 1
right 1
side 1
You 1
re 1
mad 1
Here 1
is 1
the 1
note 1
written 1
in 1
pencil 1
over 1
here 1
And 1
over 1
here 1
is 1
what 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
fragment 1
of 1
a 1
hotel 1
bill 1
which 1
interests 1
me 1
deeply 1
There 1
s 1
nothing 1
in 1
it 1
I 1
looked 1
at 1
it 1
before 1

Very 1

It 1

As 1
to 1
the 1
note 1
it 1
is 1
important 1
also 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
the 1
initials 1
are 1
so 1
I 1
congratulate 1
you 1
again 1
I 1
ve 1
wasted 1
time 1
enough 1
said 1
Lestrade 1
rising 1
I 1
believe 1
in 1
hard 1
work 1
and 1
not 1
in 1
sitting 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
spinning 1
fine 1
theories 1
Good 1
day 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
which 1
gets 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
first 1
He 1
gathered 1
up 1
the 1
garments 1
thrust 1
them 1
into 1
the 1
bag 1
and 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
door 1
Just 1
one 1
hint 1
to 1
you 1
Lestrade 1
drawled 1
Holmes 1
before 1
his 1
rival 1
vanished 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
true 1
solution 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
Lady 1
St 1
Simon 1
is 1
a 1
myth 1
There 1
is 1
not 1
and 1
there 1
never 1
has 1
been 1
any 1
such 1
person 1
Lestrade 1
looked 1
sadly 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
Then 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
me 1
tapped 1
his 1
forehead 1
three 1
times 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
solemnly 1
and 1
hurried 1
away 1
He 1
had 1
hardly 1
shut 1
the 1
door 1
behind 1
him 1
when 1
Holmes 1
rose 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
overcoat 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
in 1
what 1
the 1
fellow 1
says 1
about 1
outdoor 1
work 1
he 1
remarked 1
so 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
papers 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
It 1
was 1
after 1
five 1
o 1
clock 1
when 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
left 1
me 1
but 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
time 1
to 1
be 1
lonely 1
for 1
within 1
an 1
hour 1
there 1
arrived 1
a 1
confectioner 1
s 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
flat 1
box 1
This 1
he 1
unpacked 1
with 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
a 1
youth 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
presently 1
to 1
my 1
very 1
great 1
astonishment 1
a 1
quite 1
epicurean 1
little 1
cold 1
supper 1
began 1
to 1
be 1
laid 1
out 1
upon 1
our 1
humble 1
lodging 1
house 1
mahogany 1
There 1
were 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
brace 1
of 1
cold 1
woodcock 1
a 1
pheasant 1
a 1
pate 1
de 1
foie 1
gras 1
pie 1
with 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
ancient 1
and 1
cobwebby 1
bottles 1
Having 1
laid 1
out 1
all 1
these 1
luxuries 1
my 1
two 1
visitors 1
vanished 1
away 1
like 1
the 1
genii 1
of 1
the 1
Arabian 1
Nights 1
with 1
no 1
explanation 1
save 1
that 1
the 1
things 1
had 1
been 1
paid 1
for 1
and 1
were 1
ordered 1
to 1
this 1
address 1
Just 1
before 1
nine 1
o 1
clock 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
stepped 1
briskly 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
His 1
features 1
were 1
gravely 1
set 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
his 1
eye 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
disappointed 1
in 1
his 1
conclusions 1
They 1
have 1
laid 1
the 1
supper 1
then 1
he 1
said 1
rubbing 1
his 1
hands 1
You 1
seem 1
to 1
expect 1
company 1
They 1
have 1
laid 1
for 1
five 1
Yes 1
I 1
fancy 1
we 1
may 1
have 1
some 1
company 1
dropping 1
in 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
am 1
surprised 1
that 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
has 1
not 1
already 1
arrived 1
Ha 1
I 1
fancy 1
that 1
I 1
hear 1
his 1
step 1
now 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs 1
It 1
was 1
indeed 1
our 1
visitor 1
of 1
the 1
afternoon 1
who 1
came 1
bustling 1
in 1
dangling 1
his 1
glasses 1
more 1
vigorously 1
than 1
ever 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
perturbed 1
expression 1
upon 1
his 1
aristocratic 1
features 1
My 1
messenger 1
reached 1
you 1
then 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
Yes 1
and 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
the 1
contents 1
startled 1
me 1
beyond 1
measure 1
Have 1
you 1
good 1
authority 1
for 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
The 1
best 1
possible 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
sank 1
into 1
a 1
chair 1
and 1
passed 1
his 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
forehead 1
What 1
will 1
the 1
Duke 1
say 1
he 1
murmured 1
when 1
he 1
hears 1
that 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
has 1
been 1
subjected 1
to 1
such 1
humiliation 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
purest 1
accident 1
I 1
cannot 1
allow 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
humiliation 1
Ah 1
you 1
look 1
on 1
these 1
things 1
from 1
another 1
standpoint 1
I 1
fail 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
anyone 1
is 1
to 1
blame 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
lady 1
could 1
have 1
acted 1
otherwise 1
though 1
her 1
abrupt 1
method 1
of 1
doing 1
it 1
was 1
undoubtedly 1
to 1
be 1
regretted 1
Having 1
no 1
mother 1
she 1
had 1
no 1
one 1
to 1
advise 1
her 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
crisis 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
slight 1
sir 1
a 1
public 1
slight 1
said 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
tapping 1
his 1
fingers 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
You 1
must 1
make 1
allowance 1
for 1
this 1
poor 1
girl 1
placed 1
in 1
so 1
unprecedented 1
a 1
position 1
I 1
will 1
make 1
no 1
allowance 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
angry 1
indeed 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
shamefully 1
used 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
ring 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Yes 1
there 1
are 1
steps 1
on 1
the 1
landing 1
If 1
I 1
cannot 1
persuade 1
you 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
lenient 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
I 1
have 1
brought 1
an 1
advocate 1
here 1
who 1
may 1
be 1
more 1
successful 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
ushered 1
in 1
a 1
lady 1
and 1
gentleman 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
said 1
he 1
allow 1
me 1
to 1
introduce 1
you 1
to 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Francis 1
Hay 1
Moulton 1
The 1
lady 1
I 1
think 1
you 1
have 1
already 1
met 1
At 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
these 1
newcomers 1
our 1
client 1
had 1
sprung 1
from 1
his 1
seat 1
and 1
stood 1
very 1
erect 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
cast 1
down 1
and 1
his 1
hand 1
thrust 1
into 1
the 1
breast 1
of 1
his 1
frock 1
coat 1
a 1
picture 1
of 1
offended 1
dignity 1
The 1
lady 1
had 1
taken 1
a 1
quick 1
step 1
forward 1
and 1
had 1
held 1
out 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
him 1
but 1
he 1
still 1
refused 1
to 1
raise 1
his 1
eyes 1
It 1
was 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
his 1
resolution 1
perhaps 1
for 1
her 1
pleading 1
face 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
to 1
resist 1
You 1
re 1
angry 1
Robert 1
said 1
she 1
Well 1
I 1
guess 1
you 1
have 1
every 1
cause 1
to 1
be 1
Pray 1
make 1
no 1
apology 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
bitterly 1
Oh 1
yes 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
treated 1
you 1
real 1
bad 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
you 1
before 1
I 1
went 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
kind 1
of 1
rattled 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
Frank 1
here 1
again 1
I 1
just 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
doing 1
or 1
saying 1
I 1
only 1
wonder 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
fall 1
down 1
and 1
do 1
a 1
faint 1
right 1
there 1
before 1
the 1
altar 1
Perhaps 1
Mrs 1
Moulton 1
you 1
would 1
like 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
me 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
room 1
while 1
you 1
explain 1
this 1
matter 1
If 1
I 1
may 1
give 1
an 1
opinion 1
remarked 1
the 1
strange 1
gentleman 1
we 1
ve 1
had 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
secrecy 1
over 1
this 1
business 1
already 1
For 1
my 1
part 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
all 1
Europe 1
and 1
America 1
to 1
hear 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
it 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
wiry 1
sunburnt 1
man 1
clean 1
shaven 1
with 1
a 1
sharp 1
face 1
and 1
alert 1
manner 1
Then 1
I 1
ll 1
tell 1
our 1
story 1
right 1
away 1
said 1
the 1
lady 1
Frank 1
here 1
and 1
I 1
met 1
in 1
in 1
McQuire 1
s 1
camp 1
near 1
the 1
Rockies 1
where 1
pa 1
was 1
working 1
a 1
claim 1
We 1
were 1
engaged 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
Frank 1
and 1
I 1
but 1
then 1
one 1
day 1
father 1
struck 1
a 1
rich 1
pocket 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
pile 1
while 1
poor 1
Frank 1
here 1
had 1
a 1
claim 1
that 1
petered 1
out 1
and 1
came 1
to 1
nothing 1
The 1
richer 1
pa 1
grew 1
the 1
poorer 1
was 1
Frank 1
so 1
at 1
last 1
pa 1
wouldn 1
t 1
hear 1
of 1
our 1
engagement 1
lasting 1
any 1
longer 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
me 1
away 1
to 1
Frisco 1
Frank 1
wouldn 1
t 1
throw 1
up 1
his 1
hand 1
though 1
so 1
he 1
followed 1
me 1
there 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
me 1
without 1
pa 1
knowing 1
anything 1
about 1
it 1
It 1
would 1
only 1
have 1
made 1
him 1
mad 1
to 1
know 1
so 1
we 1
just 1
fixed 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
for 1
ourselves 1
Frank 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
go 1
and 1
make 1
his 1
pile 1
too 1
and 1
never 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
claim 1
me 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
pa 1
So 1
then 1
I 1
promised 1
to 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
time 1
and 1
pledged 1
myself 1
not 1
to 1
marry 1
anyone 1
else 1
while 1
he 1
lived 1
Why 1
shouldn 1
t 1
we 1
be 1
married 1
right 1
away 1
then 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
will 1
feel 1
sure 1
of 1
you 1
and 1
I 1
won 1
t 1
claim 1
to 1
be 1
your 1
husband 1
until 1
I 1
come 1
back 1
Well 1
we 1
talked 1
it 1
over 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
fixed 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
so 1
nicely 1
with 1
a 1
clergyman 1
all 1
ready 1
in 1
waiting 1
that 1
we 1
just 1
did 1
it 1
right 1
there 1
and 1
then 1
Frank 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
seek 1
his 1
fortune 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
pa 1
The 1
next 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
Frank 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
Montana 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
prospecting 1
in 1
Arizona 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
from 1
New 1
Mexico 1
After 1
that 1
came 1
a 1
long 1
newspaper 1
story 1
about 1
how 1
a 1
miners 1
camp 1
had 1
been 1
attacked 1
by 1
Apache 1
Indians 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
my 1
Frank 1
s 1
name 1
among 1
the 1
killed 1
I 1
fainted 1
dead 1
away 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
sick 1
for 1
months 1
after 1
Pa 1
thought 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
decline 1
and 1
took 1
me 1
to 1
half 1
the 1
doctors 1
in 1
Frisco 1
Not 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
news 1
came 1
for 1
a 1
year 1
and 1
more 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
never 1
doubted 1
that 1
Frank 1
was 1
really 1
dead 1
Then 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
came 1
to 1
Frisco 1
and 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
London 1
and 1
a 1
marriage 1
was 1
arranged 1
and 1
pa 1
was 1
very 1
pleased 1
but 1
I 1
felt 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
no 1
man 1
on 1
this 1
earth 1
would 1
ever 1
take 1
the 1
place 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
given 1
to 1
my 1
poor 1
Frank 1
Still 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
married 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
of 1
course 1
I 1
d 1
have 1
done 1
my 1
duty 1
by 1
him 1
We 1
can 1
t 1
command 1
our 1
love 1
but 1
we 1
can 1
our 1
actions 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
with 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
intention 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
just 1
as 1
good 1
a 1
wife 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
But 1
you 1
may 1
imagine 1
what 1
I 1
felt 1
when 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
altar 1
rails 1
I 1
glanced 1
back 1
and 1
saw 1
Frank 1
standing 1
and 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
pew 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
ghost 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
looked 1
again 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
with 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
question 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
ask 1
me 1
whether 1
I 1
were 1
glad 1
or 1
sorry 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
I 1
wonder 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
drop 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
everything 1
was 1
turning 1
round 1
and 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
clergyman 1
were 1
just 1
like 1
the 1
buzz 1
of 1
a 1
bee 1
in 1
my 1
ear 1
I 1
didn 1
t 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
Should 1
I 1
stop 1
the 1
service 1
and 1
make 1
a 1
scene 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
I 1
glanced 1
at 1
him 1
again 1
and 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
for 1
he 1
raised 1
his 1
finger 1
to 1
his 1
lips 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
still 1
Then 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
scribble 1
on 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
writing 1
me 1
a 1
note 1
As 1
I 1
passed 1
his 1
pew 1
on 1
the 1
way 1
out 1
I 1
dropped 1
my 1
bouquet 1
over 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
slipped 1
the 1
note 1
into 1
my 1
hand 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
me 1
the 1
flowers 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
line 1
asking 1
me 1
to 1
join 1
him 1
when 1
he 1
made 1
the 1
sign 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
never 1
doubted 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
that 1
my 1
first 1
duty 1
was 1
now 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
I 1
determined 1
to 1
do 1
just 1
whatever 1
he 1
might 1
direct 1
When 1
I 1
got 1
back 1
I 1
told 1
my 1
maid 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
him 1
in 1
California 1
and 1
had 1
always 1
been 1
his 1
friend 1
I 1
ordered 1
her 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
but 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
few 1
things 1
packed 1
and 1
my 1
ulster 1
ready 1
I 1
know 1
I 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
hard 1
before 1
his 1
mother 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
great 1
people 1
I 1
just 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
and 1
explain 1
afterwards 1
I 1
hadn 1
t 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
table 1
ten 1
minutes 1
before 1
I 1
saw 1
Frank 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
road 1
He 1
beckoned 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
then 1
began 1
walking 1
into 1
the 1
Park 1
I 1
slipped 1
out 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
things 1
and 1
followed 1
him 1
Some 1
woman 1
came 1
talking 1
something 1
or 1
other 1
about 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
to 1
me 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
little 1
I 1
heard 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
little 1
secret 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
before 1
marriage 1
also 1
but 1
I 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
her 1
and 1
soon 1
overtook 1
Frank 1
We 1
got 1
into 1
a 1
cab 1
together 1
and 1
away 1
we 1
drove 1
to 1
some 1
lodgings 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
in 1
Gordon 1
Square 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
true 1
wedding 1
after 1
all 1
those 1
years 1
of 1
waiting 1
Frank 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
prisoner 1
among 1
the 1
Apaches 1
had 1
escaped 1
came 1
on 1
to 1
Frisco 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
up 1
for 1
dead 1
and 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
England 1
followed 1
me 1
there 1
and 1
had 1
come 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
last 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
morning 1
of 1
my 1
second 1
wedding 1
I 1
saw 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
paper 1
explained 1
the 1
American 1
It 1
gave 1
the 1
name 1
and 1
the 1
church 1
but 1
not 1
where 1
the 1
lady 1
lived 1
Then 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
talk 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
we 1
should 1
do 1
and 1
Frank 1
was 1
all 1
for 1
openness 1
but 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
ashamed 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
vanish 1
away 1
and 1
never 1
see 1
any 1
of 1
them 1
again 1
just 1
sending 1
a 1
line 1
to 1
pa 1
perhaps 1
to 1
show 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
alive 1
It 1
was 1
awful 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
all 1
those 1
lords 1
and 1
ladies 1
sitting 1
round 1
that 1
breakfast 1
table 1
and 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
back 1
So 1
Frank 1
took 1
my 1
wedding 1
clothes 1
and 1
things 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
bundle 1
of 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
traced 1
and 1
dropped 1
them 1
away 1
somewhere 1
where 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
find 1
them 1
It 1
is 1
likely 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
gone 1
on 1
to 1
Paris 1
to 1
morrow 1
only 1
that 1
this 1
good 1
gentleman 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
came 1
round 1
to 1
us 1
this 1
evening 1
though 1
how 1
he 1
found 1
us 1
is 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
can 1
think 1
and 1
he 1
showed 1
us 1
very 1
clearly 1
and 1
kindly 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
wrong 1
and 1
that 1
Frank 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
putting 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
so 1
secret 1
Then 1
he 1
offered 1
to 1
give 1
us 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
talking 1
to 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
alone 1
and 1
so 1
we 1
came 1
right 1
away 1
round 1
to 1
his 1
rooms 1
at 1
once 1
Now 1
Robert 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
it 1
all 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
sorry 1
if 1
I 1
have 1
given 1
you 1
pain 1
and 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
very 1
meanly 1
of 1
me 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
had 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
relaxed 1
his 1
rigid 1
attitude 1
but 1
had 1
listened 1
with 1
a 1
frowning 1
brow 1
and 1
a 1
compressed 1
lip 1
to 1
this 1
long 1
narrative 1
Excuse 1
me 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
custom 1
to 1
discuss 1
my 1
most 1
intimate 1
personal 1
affairs 1
in 1
this 1
public 1
manner 1
Then 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
forgive 1
me 1
You 1
won 1
t 1
shake 1
hands 1
before 1
I 1
go 1
Oh 1
certainly 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
give 1
you 1
any 1
pleasure 1
He 1
put 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
coldly 1
grasped 1
that 1
which 1
she 1
extended 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
had 1
hoped 1
suggested 1
Holmes 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
joined 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
friendly 1
supper 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
you 1
ask 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
much 1
responded 1
his 1
Lordship 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
acquiesce 1
in 1
these 1
recent 1
developments 1
but 1
I 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
expected 1
to 1
make 1
merry 1
over 1
them 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
I 1
will 1
now 1
wish 1
you 1
all 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
night 1
He 1
included 1
us 1
all 1
in 1
a 1
sweeping 1
bow 1
and 1
stalked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
Then 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
you 1
at 1
least 1
will 1
honour 1
me 1
with 1
your 1
company 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
It 1
is 1
always 1
a 1
joy 1
to 1
meet 1
an 1
American 1
Mr 1
Moulton 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
folly 1
of 1
a 1
monarch 1
and 1
the 1
blundering 1
of 1
a 1
minister 1
in 1
far 1
gone 1
years 1
will 1
not 1
prevent 1
our 1
children 1
from 1
being 1
some 1
day 1
citizens 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
world 1
wide 1
country 1
under 1
a 1
flag 1
which 1
shall 1
be 1
a 1
quartering 1
of 1
the 1
Union 1
Jack 1
with 1
the 1
Stars 1
and 1
Stripes 1
The 1
case 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
interesting 1
one 1
remarked 1
Holmes 1
when 1
our 1
visitors 1
had 1
left 1
us 1
because 1
it 1
serves 1
to 1
show 1
very 1
clearly 1
how 1
simple 1
the 1
explanation 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
an 1
affair 1
which 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
almost 1
inexplicable 1
Nothing 1
could 1
be 1
more 1
natural 1
than 1
the 1
sequence 1
of 1
events 1
as 1
narrated 1
by 1
this 1
lady 1
and 1
nothing 1
stranger 1
than 1
the 1
result 1
when 1
viewed 1
for 1
instance 1
by 1
Mr 1
Lestrade 1
of 1
Scotland 1
Yard 1
You 1
were 1
not 1
yourself 1
at 1
fault 1
at 1
all 1
then 1
From 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
facts 1
were 1
very 1
obvious 1
to 1
me 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
the 1
lady 1
had 1
been 1
quite 1
willing 1
to 1
undergo 1
the 1
wedding 1
ceremony 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
repented 1
of 1
it 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
of 1
returning 1
home 1
Obviously 1
something 1
had 1
occurred 1
during 1
the 1
morning 1
then 1
to 1
cause 1
her 1
to 1
change 1
her 1
mind 1
What 1
could 1
that 1
something 1
be 1
She 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
spoken 1
to 1
anyone 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
out 1
for 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
company 1
of 1
the 1
bridegroom 1
Had 1
she 1
seen 1
someone 1
then 1
If 1
she 1
had 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
someone 1
from 1
America 1
because 1
she 1
had 1
spent 1
so 1
short 1
a 1
time 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
allowed 1
anyone 1
to 1
acquire 1
so 1
deep 1
an 1
influence 1
over 1
her 1
that 1
the 1
mere 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
would 1
induce 1
her 1
to 1
change 1
her 1
plans 1
so 1
completely 1
You 1
see 1
we 1
have 1
already 1
arrived 1
by 1
a 1
process 1
of 1
exclusion 1
at 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
have 1
seen 1
an 1
American 1
Then 1
who 1
could 1
this 1
American 1
be 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
possess 1
so 1
much 1
influence 1
over 1
her 1
It 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
lover 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
husband 1
Her 1
young 1
womanhood 1
had 1
I 1
knew 1
been 1
spent 1
in 1
rough 1
scenes 1
and 1
under 1
strange 1
conditions 1
So 1
far 1
I 1
had 1
got 1
before 1
I 1
ever 1
heard 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
s 1
narrative 1
When 1
he 1
told 1
us 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
pew 1
of 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
bride 1
s 1
manner 1
of 1
so 1
transparent 1
a 1
device 1
for 1
obtaining 1
a 1
note 1
as 1
the 1
dropping 1
of 1
a 1
bouquet 1
of 1
her 1
resort 1
to 1
her 1
confidential 1
maid 1
and 1
of 1
her 1
very 1
significant 1
allusion 1
to 1
claim 1
jumping 1
which 1
in 1
miners 1
parlance 1
means 1
taking 1
possession 1
of 1
that 1
which 1
another 1
person 1
has 1
a 1
prior 1
claim 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
situation 1
became 1
absolutely 1
clear 1
She 1
had 1
gone 1
off 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
either 1
a 1
lover 1
or 1
was 1
a 1
previous 1
husband 1
the 1
chances 1
being 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
the 1
latter 1
And 1
how 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
did 1
you 1
find 1
them 1
It 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
difficult 1
but 1
friend 1
Lestrade 1
held 1
information 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
himself 1
know 1
The 1
initials 1
were 1
of 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
importance 1
but 1
more 1
valuable 1
still 1
was 1
it 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
within 1
a 1
week 1
he 1
had 1
settled 1
his 1
bill 1
at 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
select 1
London 1
hotels 1
How 1
did 1
you 1
deduce 1
the 1
select 1
By 1
the 1
select 1
prices 1
Eight 1
shillings 1
for 1
a 1
bed 1
and 1
eightpence 1
for 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
sherry 1
pointed 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
expensive 1
hotels 1
There 1
are 1
not 1
many 1
in 1
London 1
which 1
charge 1
at 1
that 1
rate 1
In 1
the 1
second 1
one 1
which 1
I 1
visited 1
in 1
Northumberland 1
Avenue 1
I 1
learned 1
by 1
an 1
inspection 1
of 1
the 1
book 1
that 1
Francis 1
H 1
Moulton 1
an 1
American 1
gentleman 1
had 1
left 1
only 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
and 1
on 1
looking 1
over 1
the 1
entries 1
against 1
him 1
I 1
came 1
upon 1
the 1
very 1
items 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
duplicate 1
bill 1
His 1
letters 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
forwarded 1
to 1
Gordon 1
Square 1
so 1
thither 1
I 1
travelled 1
and 1
being 1
fortunate 1
enough 1
to 1
find 1
the 1
loving 1
couple 1
at 1
home 1
I 1
ventured 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
some 1
paternal 1
advice 1
and 1
to 1
point 1
out 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
make 1
their 1
position 1
a 1
little 1
clearer 1
both 1
to 1
the 1
general 1
public 1
and 1
to 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
in 1
particular 1
I 1
invited 1
them 1
to 1
meet 1
him 1
here 1
and 1
as 1
you 1
see 1
I 1
made 1
him 1
keep 1
the 1
appointment 1
But 1
with 1
no 1
very 1
good 1
result 1
I 1
remarked 1
His 1
conduct 1
was 1
certainly 1
not 1
very 1
gracious 1
Ah 1
Watson 1
said 1
Holmes 1
smiling 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
gracious 1
either 1
if 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
trouble 1
of 1
wooing 1
and 1
wedding 1
you 1
found 1
yourself 1
deprived 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
of 1
wife 1
and 1
of 1
fortune 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
judge 1
Lord 1
St 1
Simon 1
very 1
mercifully 1
and 1
thank 1
our 1
stars 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
never 1
likely 1
to 1
find 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
position 1
Draw 1
your 1
chair 1
up 1
and 1
hand 1
me 1
my 1
violin 1
for 1
the 1
only 1
problem 1
we 1
have 1
still 1
to 1
solve 1
is 1
how 1
to 1
while 1
away 1
these 1
bleak 1
autumnal 1
evenings 1
XI 1
THE 1
ADVENTURE 1
OF 1
THE 1
BERYL 1
CORONET 1
Holmes 1
said 1
I 1
as 1
I 1
stood 1
one 1
morning 1
in 1
our 1
bow 1
window 1
looking 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
madman 1
coming 1
along 1
It 1
seems 1
rather 1
sad 1
that 1
his 1
relatives 1
should 1
allow 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
out 1
alone 1
My 1
friend 1
rose 1
lazily 1
from 1
his 1
armchair 1
and 1
stood 1
with 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
the 1
pockets 1
of 1
his 1
dressing 1
gown 1
looking 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
bright 1
crisp 1
February 1
morning 1
and 1
the 1
snow 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
still 1
lay 1
deep 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
shimmering 1
brightly 1
in 1
the 1
wintry 1
sun 1
Down 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
Baker 1
Street 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
ploughed 1
into 1
a 1
brown 1
crumbly 1
band 1
by 1
the 1
traffic 1
but 1
at 1
either 1
side 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
heaped 1
up 1
edges 1
of 1
the 1
foot 1
paths 1
it 1
still 1
lay 1
as 1
white 1
as 1
when 1
it 1
fell 1
The 1
grey 1
pavement 1
had 1
been 1
cleaned 1
and 1
scraped 1
but 1
was 1
still 1
dangerously 1
slippery 1
so 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
fewer 1
passengers 1
than 1
usual 1
Indeed 1
from 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
Metropolitan 1
Station 1
no 1
one 1
was 1
coming 1
save 1
the 1
single 1
gentleman 1
whose 1
eccentric 1
conduct 1
had 1
drawn 1
my 1
attention 1
He 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
about 1
fifty 1
tall 1
portly 1
and 1
imposing 1
with 1
a 1
massive 1
strongly 1
marked 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
commanding 1
figure 1
He 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
sombre 1
yet 1
rich 1
style 1
in 1
black 1
frock 1
coat 1
shining 1
hat 1
neat 1
brown 1
gaiters 1
and 1
well 1
cut 1
pearl 1
grey 1
trousers 1
Yet 1
his 1
actions 1
were 1
in 1
absurd 1
contrast 1
to 1
the 1
dignity 1
of 1
his 1
dress 1
and 1
features 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
hard 1
with 1
occasional 1
little 1
springs 1
such 1
as 1
a 1
weary 1
man 1
gives 1
who 1
is 1
little 1
accustomed 1
to 1
set 1
any 1
tax 1
upon 1
his 1
legs 1
As 1
he 1
ran 1
he 1
jerked 1
his 1
hands 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
waggled 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
writhed 1
his 1
face 1
into 1
the 1
most 1
extraordinary 1
contortions 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
can 1
be 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
him 1
I 1
asked 1
He 1
is 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
numbers 1
of 1
the 1
houses 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
coming 1
here 1
said 1
Holmes 1
rubbing 1
his 1
hands 1
Here 1
Yes 1
I 1
rather 1
think 1
he 1
is 1
coming 1
to 1
consult 1
me 1
professionally 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
recognise 1
the 1
symptoms 1
Ha 1
did 1
I 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
the 1
man 1
puffing 1
and 1
blowing 1
rushed 1
at 1
our 1
door 1
and 1
pulled 1
at 1
our 1
bell 1
until 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
resounded 1
with 1
the 1
clanging 1
A 1
few 1
moments 1
later 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
our 1
room 1
still 1
puffing 1
still 1
gesticulating 1
but 1
with 1
so 1
fixed 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
grief 1
and 1
despair 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
our 1
smiles 1
were 1
turned 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
to 1
horror 1
and 1
pity 1
For 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
his 1
words 1
out 1
but 1
swayed 1
his 1
body 1
and 1
plucked 1
at 1
his 1
hair 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
driven 1
to 1
the 1
extreme 1
limits 1
of 1
his 1
reason 1
Then 1
suddenly 1
springing 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
he 1
beat 1
his 1
head 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
with 1
such 1
force 1
that 1
we 1
both 1
rushed 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
tore 1
him 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
pushed 1
him 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
easy 1
chair 1
and 1
sitting 1
beside 1
him 1
patted 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
chatted 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
easy 1
soothing 1
tones 1
which 1
he 1
knew 1
so 1
well 1
how 1
to 1
employ 1
You 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
tell 1
your 1
story 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
said 1
he 1
You 1
are 1
fatigued 1
with 1
your 1
haste 1
Pray 1
wait 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
recovered 1
yourself 1
and 1
then 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
most 1
happy 1
to 1
look 1
into 1
any 1
little 1
problem 1
which 1
you 1
may 1
submit 1
to 1
me 1
The 1
man 1
sat 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
more 1
with 1
a 1
heaving 1
chest 1
fighting 1
against 1
his 1
emotion 1
Then 1
he 1
passed 1
his 1
handkerchief 1
over 1
his 1
brow 1
set 1
his 1
lips 1
tight 1
and 1
turned 1
his 1
face 1
towards 1
us 1
No 1
doubt 1
you 1
think 1
me 1
mad 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
some 1
great 1
trouble 1
responded 1
Holmes 1
God 1
knows 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
trouble 1
which 1
is 1
enough 1
to 1
unseat 1
my 1
reason 1
so 1
sudden 1
and 1
so 1
terrible 1
is 1
it 1
Public 1
disgrace 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
faced 1
although 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
character 1
has 1
never 1
yet 1
borne 1
a 1
stain 1
Private 1
affliction 1
also 1
is 1
the 1
lot 1
of 1
every 1
man 1
but 1
the 1
two 1
coming 1
together 1
and 1
in 1
so 1
frightful 1
a 1
form 1
have 1
been 1
enough 1
to 1
shake 1
my 1
very 1
soul 1
Besides 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
I 1
alone 1
The 1
very 1
noblest 1
in 1
the 1
land 1
may 1
suffer 1
unless 1
some 1
way 1
be 1
found 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
horrible 1
affair 1
Pray 1
compose 1
yourself 1
sir 1
said 1
Holmes 1
and 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
a 1
clear 1
account 1
of 1
who 1
you 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
has 1
befallen 1
you 1
My 1
name 1
answered 1
our 1
visitor 1
is 1
probably 1
familiar 1
to 1
your 1
ears 1
I 1
am 1
Alexander 1
Holder 1
of 1
the 1
banking 1
firm 1
of 1
Holder 1
Stevenson 1
of 1
Threadneedle 1
Street 1
The 1
name 1
was 1
indeed 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
us 1
as 1
belonging 1
to 1
the 1
senior 1
partner 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
largest 1
private 1
banking 1
concern 1
in 1
the 1
City 1
of 1
London 1
What 1
could 1
have 1
happened 1
then 1
to 1
bring 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
foremost 1
citizens 1
of 1
London 1
to 1
this 1
most 1
pitiable 1
pass 1
We 1
waited 1
all 1
curiosity 1
until 1
with 1
another 1
effort 1
he 1
braced 1
himself 1
to 1
tell 1
his 1
story 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
time 1
is 1
of 1
value 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
I 1
hastened 1
here 1
when 1
the 1
police 1
inspector 1
suggested 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
secure 1
your 1
co 1
operation 1
I 1
came 1
to 1
Baker 1
Street 1
by 1
the 1
Underground 1
and 1
hurried 1
from 1
there 1
on 1
foot 1
for 1
the 1
cabs 1
go 1
slowly 1
through 1
this 1
snow 1
That 1
is 1
why 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
out 1
of 1
breath 1
for 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
takes 1
very 1
little 1
exercise 1
I 1
feel 1
better 1
now 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
put 1
the 1
facts 1
before 1
you 1
as 1
shortly 1
and 1
yet 1
as 1
clearly 1
as 1
I 1
can 1
It 1
is 1
of 1
course 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
you 1
that 1
in 1
a 1
successful 1
banking 1
business 1
as 1
much 1
depends 1
upon 1
our 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
find 1
remunerative 1
investments 1
for 1
our 1
funds 1
as 1
upon 1
our 1
increasing 1
our 1
connection 1
and 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
our 1
depositors 1
One 1
of 1
our 1
most 1
lucrative 1
means 1
of 1
laying 1
out 1
money 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
loans 1
where 1
the 1
security 1
is 1
unimpeachable 1
We 1
have 1
done 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
in 1
this 1
direction 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
years 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
noble 1
families 1
to 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
advanced 1
large 1
sums 1
upon 1
the 1
security 1
of 1
their 1
pictures 1
libraries 1
or 1
plate 1
Yesterday 1
morning 1
I 1
was 1
seated 1
in 1
my 1
office 1
at 1
the 1
bank 1
when 1
a 1
card 1
was 1
brought 1
in 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
clerks 1
I 1
started 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
name 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
well 1
perhaps 1
even 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
name 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
household 1
word 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
earth 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
highest 1
noblest 1
most 1
exalted 1
names 1
in 1
England 1
I 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
the 1
honour 1
and 1
attempted 1
when 1
he 1
entered 1
to 1
say 1
so 1
but 1
he 1
plunged 1
at 1
once 1
into 1
business 1
with 1
the 1
air 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
wishes 1
to 1
hurry 1
quickly 1
through 1
a 1
disagreeable 1
task 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
informed 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
advancing 1
money 1
The 1
firm 1
does 1
so 1
when 1
the 1
security 1
is 1
good 1
I 1
answered 1
It 1
is 1
absolutely 1
essential 1
to 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
have 1
pounds 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
could 1
of 1
course 1
borrow 1
so 1
trifling 1
a 1
sum 1
ten 1
times 1
over 1
from 1
my 1
friends 1
but 1
I 1
much 1
prefer 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
business 1
and 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
that 1
business 1
myself 1
In 1
my 1
position 1
you 1
can 1
readily 1
understand 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
unwise 1
to 1
place 1
one 1
s 1
self 1
under 1
obligations 1
For 1
how 1
long 1
may 1
I 1
ask 1
do 1
you 1
want 1
this 1
sum 1
I 1
asked 1
Next 1
Monday 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
large 1
sum 1
due 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
then 1
most 1
certainly 1
repay 1
what 1
you 1
advance 1
with 1
whatever 1
interest 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
right 1
to 1
charge 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
essential 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
money 1
should 1
be 1
paid 1
at 1
once 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
advance 1
it 1
without 1
further 1
parley 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
private 1
purse 1
said 1
I 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
that 1
the 1
strain 1
would 1
be 1
rather 1
more 1
than 1
it 1
could 1
bear 1
If 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand 1
I 1
am 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
firm 1
then 1
in 1
justice 1
to 1
my 1
partner 1
I 1
must 1
insist 1
that 1
even 1
in 1
your 1
case 1
every 1
businesslike 1
precaution 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
I 1
should 1
much 1
prefer 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
so 1
said 1
he 1
raising 1
up 1
a 1
square 1
black 1
morocco 1
case 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
laid 1
beside 1
his 1
chair 1
You 1
have 1
doubtless 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
Beryl 1
Coronet 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
precious 1
public 1
possessions 1
of 1
the 1
empire 1
said 1
I 1
Precisely 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
there 1
imbedded 1
in 1
soft 1
flesh 1
coloured 1
velvet 1
lay 1
the 1
magnificent 1
piece 1
of 1
jewellery 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
named 1
There 1
are 1
thirty 1
nine 1
enormous 1
beryls 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
price 1
of 1
the 1
gold 1
chasing 1
is 1
incalculable 1
The 1
lowest 1
estimate 1
would 1
put 1
the 1
worth 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
at 1
double 1
the 1
sum 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
asked 1
I 1
am 1
prepared 1
to 1
leave 1
it 1
with 1
you 1
as 1
my 1
security 1
I 1
took 1
the 1
precious 1
case 1
into 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
looked 1
in 1
some 1
perplexity 1
from 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
illustrious 1
client 1
You 1
doubt 1
its 1
value 1
he 1
asked 1
Not 1
at 1
all 1
I 1
only 1
doubt 1
The 1
propriety 1
of 1
my 1
leaving 1
it 1
You 1
may 1
set 1
your 1
mind 1
at 1
rest 1
about 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
doing 1
so 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
absolutely 1
certain 1
that 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
in 1
four 1
days 1
to 1
reclaim 1
it 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
pure 1
matter 1
of 1
form 1
Is 1
the 1
security 1
sufficient 1
Ample 1
You 1
understand 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
giving 1
you 1
a 1
strong 1
proof 1
of 1
the 1
confidence 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
in 1
you 1
founded 1
upon 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
rely 1
upon 1
you 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
be 1
discreet 1
and 1
to 1
refrain 1
from 1
all 1
gossip 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
but 1
above 1
all 1
to 1
preserve 1
this 1
coronet 1
with 1
every 1
possible 1
precaution 1
because 1
I 1
need 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
a 1
great 1
public 1
scandal 1
would 1
be 1
caused 1
if 1
any 1
harm 1
were 1
to 1
befall 1
it 1
Any 1
injury 1
to 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
almost 1
as 1
serious 1
as 1
its 1
complete 1
loss 1
for 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
beryls 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
match 1
these 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
impossible 1
to 1
replace 1
them 1
I 1
leave 1
it 1
with 1
you 1
however 1
with 1
every 1
confidence 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
call 1
for 1
it 1
in 1
person 1
on 1
Monday 1
morning 1
Seeing 1
that 1
my 1
client 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
leave 1
I 1
said 1
no 1
more 1
but 1
calling 1
for 1
my 1
cashier 1
I 1
ordered 1
him 1
to 1
pay 1
over 1
fifty 1
pound 1
notes 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
alone 1
once 1
more 1
however 1
with 1
the 1
precious 1
case 1
lying 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
but 1
think 1
with 1
some 1
misgivings 1
of 1
the 1
immense 1
responsibility 1
which 1
it 1
entailed 1
upon 1
me 1
There 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
national 1
possession 1
a 1
horrible 1
scandal 1
would 1
ensue 1
if 1
any 1
misfortune 1
should 1
occur 1
to 1
it 1
I 1
already 1
regretted 1
having 1
ever 1
consented 1
to 1
take 1
charge 1
of 1
it 1
However 1
it 1
was 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
alter 1
the 1
matter 1
now 1
so 1
I 1
locked 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
private 1
safe 1
and 1
turned 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
my 1
work 1
When 1
evening 1
came 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
imprudence 1
to 1
leave 1
so 1
precious 1
a 1
thing 1
in 1
the 1
office 1
behind 1
me 1
Bankers 1
safes 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
before 1
now 1
and 1
why 1
should 1
not 1
mine 1
be 1
If 1
so 1
how 1
terrible 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
find 1
myself 1
I 1
determined 1
therefore 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
next 1
few 1
days 1
I 1
would 1
always 1
carry 1
the 1
case 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
with 1
me 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
never 1
be 1
really 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
reach 1
With 1
this 1
intention 1
I 1
called 1
a 1
cab 1
and 1
drove 1
out 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
at 1
Streatham 1
carrying 1
the 1
jewel 1
with 1
me 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
breathe 1
freely 1
until 1
I 1
had 1
taken 1
it 1
upstairs 1
and 1
locked 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
bureau 1
of 1
my 1
dressing 1
room 1
And 1
now 1
a 1
word 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
household 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
for 1
I 1
wish 1
you 1
to 1
thoroughly 1
understand 1
the 1
situation 1
My 1
groom 1
and 1
my 1
page 1
sleep 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
may 1
be 1
set 1
aside 1
altogether 1
I 1
have 1
three 1
maid 1
servants 1
who 1
have 1
been 1
with 1
me 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
years 1
and 1
whose 1
absolute 1
reliability 1
is 1
quite 1
above 1
suspicion 1
Another 1
Lucy 1
Parr 1
the 1
second 1
waiting 1
maid 1
has 1
only 1
been 1
in 1
my 1
service 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
She 1
came 1
with 1
an 1
excellent 1
character 1
however 1
and 1
has 1
always 1
given 1
me 1
satisfaction 1
She 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
pretty 1
girl 1
and 1
has 1
attracted 1
admirers 1
who 1
have 1
occasionally 1
hung 1
about 1
the 1
place 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
drawback 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
found 1
to 1
her 1
but 1
we 1
believe 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
thoroughly 1
good 1
girl 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
So 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
servants 1
My 1
family 1
itself 1
is 1
so 1
small 1
that 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
take 1
me 1
long 1
to 1
describe 1
it 1
I 1
am 1
a 1
widower 1
and 1
have 1
an 1
only 1
son 1
Arthur 1
He 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
disappointment 1
to 1
me 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
a 1
grievous 1
disappointment 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
myself 1
to 1
blame 1
People 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
spoiled 1
him 1
Very 1
likely 1
I 1
have 1
When 1
my 1
dear 1
wife 1
died 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
love 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
smile 1
fade 1
even 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
from 1
his 1
face 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
denied 1
him 1
a 1
wish 1
Perhaps 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
better 1
for 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
had 1
I 1
been 1
sterner 1
but 1
I 1
meant 1
it 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
It 1
was 1
naturally 1
my 1
intention 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
succeed 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
business 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
of 1
a 1
business 1
turn 1
He 1
was 1
wild 1
wayward 1
and 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
truth 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
trust 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
handling 1
of 1
large 1
sums 1
of 1
money 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
young 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
member 1
of 1
an 1
aristocratic 1
club 1
and 1
there 1
having 1
charming 1
manners 1
he 1
was 1
soon 1
the 1
intimate 1
of 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
men 1
with 1
long 1
purses 1
and 1
expensive 1
habits 1
He 1
learned 1
to 1
play 1
heavily 1
at 1
cards 1
and 1
to 1
squander 1
money 1
on 1
the 1
turf 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
implore 1
me 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
an 1
advance 1
upon 1
his 1
allowance 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
settle 1
his 1
debts 1
of 1
honour 1
He 1
tried 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
to 1
break 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
dangerous 1
company 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
keeping 1
but 1
each 1
time 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
his 1
friend 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
was 1
enough 1
to 1
draw 1
him 1
back 1
again 1
And 1
indeed 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
wonder 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
should 1
gain 1
an 1
influence 1
over 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
has 1
frequently 1
brought 1
him 1
to 1
my 1
house 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
found 1
myself 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
resist 1
the 1
fascination 1
of 1
his 1
manner 1
He 1
is 1
older 1
than 1
Arthur 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
to 1
his 1
finger 1
tips 1
one 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
everywhere 1
seen 1
everything 1
a 1
brilliant 1
talker 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
great 1
personal 1
beauty 1
Yet 1
when 1
I 1
think 1
of 1
him 1
in 1
cold 1
blood 1
far 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
glamour 1
of 1
his 1
presence 1
I 1
am 1
convinced 1
from 1
his 1
cynical 1
speech 1
and 1
the 1
look 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
caught 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
one 1
who 1
should 1
be 1
deeply 1
distrusted 1
So 1
I 1
think 1
and 1
so 1
too 1
thinks 1
my 1
little 1
Mary 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
quick 1
insight 1
into 1
character 1
And 1
now 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
she 1
to 1
be 1
described 1
She 1
is 1
my 1
niece 1
but 1
when 1
my 1
brother 1
died 1
five 1
years 1
ago 1
and 1
left 1
her 1
alone 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
I 1
adopted 1
her 1
and 1
have 1
looked 1
upon 1
her 1
ever 1
since 1
as 1
my 1
daughter 1
She 1
is 1
a 1
sunbeam 1
in 1
my 1
house 1
sweet 1
loving 1
beautiful 1
a 1
wonderful 1
manager 1
and 1
housekeeper 1
yet 1
as 1
tender 1
and 1
quiet 1
and 1
gentle 1
as 1
a 1
woman 1
could 1
be 1
She 1
is 1
my 1
right 1
hand 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
could 1
do 1
without 1
her 1
In 1
only 1
one 1
matter 1
has 1
she 1
ever 1
gone 1
against 1
my 1
wishes 1
Twice 1
my 1
boy 1
has 1
asked 1
her 1
to 1
marry 1
him 1
for 1
he 1
loves 1
her 1
devotedly 1
but 1
each 1
time 1
she 1
has 1
refused 1
him 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
if 1
anyone 1
could 1
have 1
drawn 1
him 1
into 1
the 1
right 1
path 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
she 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
marriage 1
might 1
have 1
changed 1
his 1
whole 1
life 1
but 1
now 1
alas 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
late 1
forever 1
too 1
late 1
Now 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
live 1
under 1
my 1
roof 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
continue 1
with 1
my 1
miserable 1
story 1
When 1
we 1
were 1
taking 1
coffee 1
in 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
that 1
night 1
after 1
dinner 1
I 1
told 1
Arthur 1
and 1
Mary 1
my 1
experience 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
precious 1
treasure 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
under 1
our 1
roof 1
suppressing 1
only 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
my 1
client 1
Lucy 1
Parr 1
who 1
had 1
brought 1
in 1
the 1
coffee 1
had 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
but 1
I 1
cannot 1
swear 1
that 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
closed 1
Mary 1
and 1
Arthur 1
were 1
much 1
interested 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
famous 1
coronet 1
but 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
better 1
not 1
to 1
disturb 1
it 1
Where 1
have 1
you 1
put 1
it 1
asked 1
Arthur 1
In 1
my 1
own 1
bureau 1
Well 1
I 1
hope 1
to 1
goodness 1
the 1
house 1
won 1
t 1
be 1
burgled 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
is 1
locked 1
up 1
I 1
answered 1
Oh 1
any 1
old 1
key 1
will 1
fit 1
that 1
bureau 1
When 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
youngster 1
I 1
have 1
opened 1
it 1
myself 1
with 1
the 1
key 1
of 1
the 1
box 1
room 1
cupboard 1
He 1
often 1
had 1
a 1
wild 1
way 1
of 1
talking 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
thought 1
little 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
He 1
followed 1
me 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
however 1
that 1
night 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
grave 1
face 1
Look 1
here 1
dad 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
his 1
eyes 1
cast 1
down 1
can 1
you 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
pounds 1
No 1
I 1
cannot 1
I 1
answered 1
sharply 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
far 1
too 1
generous 1
with 1
you 1
in 1
money 1
matters 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
very 1
kind 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
this 1
money 1
or 1
else 1
I 1
can 1
never 1
show 1
my 1
face 1
inside 1
the 1
club 1
again 1
And 1
a 1
very 1
good 1
thing 1
too 1
I 1
cried 1
Yes 1
but 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
me 1
leave 1
it 1
a 1
dishonoured 1
man 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
bear 1
the 1
disgrace 1
I 1
must 1
raise 1
the 1
money 1
in 1
some 1
way 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
it 1
then 1
I 1
must 1
try 1
other 1
means 1
I 1
was 1
very 1
angry 1
for 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
third 1
demand 1
during 1
the 1
month 1
You 1
shall 1
not 1
have 1
a 1
farthing 1
from 1
me 1
I 1
cried 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
bowed 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room 1
without 1
another 1
word 1
When 1
he 1
was 1
gone 1
I 1
unlocked 1
my 1
bureau 1
made 1
sure 1
that 1
my 1
treasure 1
was 1
safe 1
and 1
locked 1
it 1
again 1
Then 1
I 1
started 1
to 1
go 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
secure 1
a 1
duty 1
which 1
I 1
usually 1
leave 1
to 1
Mary 1
but 1
which 1
I 1
thought 1
it 1
well 1
to 1
perform 1
myself 1
that 1
night 1
As 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
I 1
saw 1
Mary 1
herself 1
at 1
the 1
side 1
window 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
which 1
she 1
closed 1
and 1
fastened 1
as 1
I 1
approached 1
Tell 1
me 1
dad 1
said 1
she 1
looking 1
I 1
thought 1
a 1
little 1
disturbed 1
did 1
you 1
give 1
Lucy 1
the 1
maid 1
leave 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
to 1
night 1
Certainly 1
not 1
She 1
came 1
in 1
just 1
now 1
by 1
the 1
back 1
door 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
only 1
been 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
gate 1
to 1
see 1
someone 1
but 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
hardly 1
safe 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
stopped 1
You 1
must 1
speak 1
to 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
or 1
I 1
will 1
if 1
you 1
prefer 1
it 1
Are 1
you 1
sure 1
that 1
everything 1
is 1
fastened 1
Quite 1
sure 1
dad 1
Then 1
good 1
night 1
I 1
kissed 1
her 1
and 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
bedroom 1
again 1
where 1
I 1
was 1
soon 1
asleep 1
I 1
am 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
everything 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
any 1
bearing 1
upon 1
the 1
case 1
but 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
question 1
me 1
upon 1
any 1
point 1
which 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
make 1
clear 1
On 1
the 1
contrary 1
your 1
statement 1
is 1
singularly 1
lucid 1
I 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
my 1
story 1
now 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
particularly 1
so 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
heavy 1
sleeper 1
and 1
the 1
anxiety 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
tended 1
no 1
doubt 1
to 1
make 1
me 1
even 1
less 1
so 1
than 1
usual 1
About 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
then 1
I 1
was 1
awakened 1
by 1
some 1
sound 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
It 1
had 1
ceased 1
ere 1
I 1
was 1
wide 1
awake 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
left 1
an 1
impression 1
behind 1
it 1
as 1
though 1
a 1
window 1
had 1
gently 1
closed 1
somewhere 1
I 1
lay 1
listening 1
with 1
all 1
my 1
ears 1
Suddenly 1
to 1
my 1
horror 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
distinct 1
sound 1
of 1
footsteps 1
moving 1
softly 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
room 1
I 1
slipped 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
all 1
palpitating 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
peeped 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
my 1
dressing 1
room 1
door 1
Arthur 1
I 1
screamed 1
you 1
villain 1
you 1
thief 1
How 1
dare 1
you 1
touch 1
that 1
coronet 1
The 1
gas 1
was 1
half 1
up 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
and 1
my 1
unhappy 1
boy 1
dressed 1
only 1
in 1
his 1
shirt 1
and 1
trousers 1
was 1
standing 1
beside 1
the 1
light 1
holding 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
He 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
wrenching 1
at 1
it 1
or 1
bending 1
it 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
strength 1
At 1
my 1
cry 1
he 1
dropped 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
grasp 1
and 1
turned 1
as 1
pale 1
as 1
death 1
I 1
snatched 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
One 1
of 1
the 1
gold 1
corners 1
with 1
three 1
of 1
the 1
beryls 1
in 1
it 1
was 1
missing 1
You 1
blackguard 1
I 1
shouted 1
beside 1
myself 1
with 1
rage 1
You 1
have 1
destroyed 1
it 1
You 1
have 1
dishonoured 1
me 1
forever 1
Where 1
are 1
the 1
jewels 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
stolen 1
Stolen 1
he 1
cried 1
Yes 1
thief 1
I 1
roared 1
shaking 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
shoulder 1
There 1
are 1
none 1
missing 1
There 1
cannot 1
be 1
any 1
missing 1
said 1
he 1
There 1
are 1
three 1
missing 1
And 1
you 1
know 1
where 1
they 1
are 1
Must 1
I 1
call 1
you 1
a 1
liar 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
thief 1
Did 1
I 1
not 1
see 1
you 1
trying 1
to 1
tear 1
off 1
another 1
piece 1
You 1
have 1
called 1
me 1
names 1
enough 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
stand 1
it 1
any 1
longer 1
I 1
shall 1
not 1
say 1
another 1
word 1
about 1
this 1
business 1
since 1
you 1
have 1
chosen 1
to 1
insult 1
me 1
I 1
will 1
leave 1
your 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
make 1
my 1
own 1
way 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
You 1
shall 1
leave 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
I 1
cried 1
half 1
mad 1
with 1
grief 1
and 1
rage 1
I 1
shall 1
have 1
this 1
matter 1
probed 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
You 1
shall 1
learn 1
nothing 1
from 1
me 1
said 1
he 1
with 1
a 1
passion 1
such 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
thought 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
nature 1
If 1
you 1
choose 1
to 1
call 1
the 1
police 1
let 1
the 1
police 1
find 1
what 1
they 1
can 1
By 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
was 1
astir 1
for 1
I 1
had 1
raised 1
my 1
voice 1
in 1
my 1
anger 1
Mary 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
rush 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
and 1
of 1
Arthur 1
s 1
face 1
she 1
read 1
the 1
whole 1
story 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
scream 1
fell 1
down 1
senseless 1
on 1
the 1
ground 1
I 1
sent 1
the 1
house 1
maid 1
for 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
put 1
the 1
investigation 1
into 1
their 1
hands 1
at 1
once 1
When 1
the 1
inspector 1
and 1
a 1
constable 1
entered 1
the 1
house 1
Arthur 1
who 1
had 1
stood 1
sullenly 1
with 1
his 1
arms 1
folded 1
asked 1
me 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
intention 1
to 1
charge 1
him 1
with 1
theft 1
I 1
answered 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
private 1
matter 1
but 1
had 1
become 1
a 1
public 1
one 1
since 1
the 1
ruined 1
coronet 1
was 1
national 1
property 1
I 1
was 1
determined 1
that 1
the 1
law 1
should 1
have 1
its 1
way 1
in 1
everything 1
At 1
least 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
have 1
me 1
arrested 1
at 1
once 1
It 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
your 1
advantage 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
mine 1
if 1
I 1
might 1
leave 1
the 1
house 1
for 1
five 1
minutes 1
That 1
you 1
may 1
get 1
away 1
or 1
perhaps 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
conceal 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
stolen 1
said 1
I 1
And 1
then 1
realising 1
the 1
dreadful 1
position 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
placed 1
I 1
implored 1
him 1
to 1
remember 1
that 1
not 1
only 1
my 1
honour 1
but 1
that 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
was 1
far 1
greater 1
than 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
stake 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
threatened 1
to 1
raise 1
a 1
scandal 1
which 1
would 1
convulse 1
the 1
nation 1
He 1
might 1
avert 1
it 1
all 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
but 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
with 1
the 1
three 1
missing 1
stones 1
You 1
may 1
as 1
well 1
face 1
the 1
matter 1
said 1
I 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
caught 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
and 1
no 1
confession 1
could 1
make 1
your 1
guilt 1
more 1
heinous 1
If 1
you 1
but 1
make 1
such 1
reparation 1
as 1
is 1
in 1
your 1
power 1
by 1
telling 1
us 1
where 1
the 1
beryls 1
are 1
all 1
shall 1
be 1
forgiven 1
and 1
forgotten 1
Keep 1
your 1
forgiveness 1
for 1
those 1
who 1
ask 1
for 1
it 1
he 1
answered 1
turning 1
away 1
from 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
sneer 1
I 1
saw 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
too 1
hardened 1
for 1
any 1
words 1
of 1
mine 1
to 1
influence 1
him 1
There 1
was 1
but 1
one 1
way 1
for 1
it 1
I 1
called 1
in 1
the 1
inspector 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
into 1
custody 1
A 1
search 1
was 1
made 1
at 1
once 1
not 1
only 1
of 1
his 1
person 1
but 1
of 1
his 1
room 1
and 1
of 1
every 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
possibly 1
have 1
concealed 1
the 1
gems 1
but 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
them 1
could 1
be 1
found 1
nor 1
would 1
the 1
wretched 1
boy 1
open 1
his 1
mouth 1
for 1
all 1
our 1
persuasions 1
and 1
our 1
threats 1
This 1
morning 1
he 1
was 1
removed 1
to 1
a 1
cell 1
and 1
I 1
after 1
going 1
through 1
all 1
the 1
police 1
formalities 1
have 1
hurried 1
round 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
implore 1
you 1
to 1
use 1
your 1
skill 1
in 1
unravelling 1
the 1
matter 1
The 1
police 1
have 1
openly 1
confessed 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
at 1
present 1
make 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
You 1
may 1
go 1
to 1
any 1
expense 1
which 1
you 1
think 1
necessary 1
I 1
have 1
already 1
offered 1
a 1
reward 1
of 1
pounds 1
My 1
God 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
I 1
have 1
lost 1
my 1
honour 1
my 1
gems 1
and 1
my 1
son 1
in 1
one 1
night 1
Oh 1
what 1
shall 1
I 1
do 1
He 1
put 1
a 1
hand 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
rocked 1
himself 1
to 1
and 1
fro 1
droning 1
to 1
himself 1
like 1
a 1
child 1
whose 1
grief 1
has 1
got 1
beyond 1
words 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sat 1
silent 1
for 1
some 1
few 1
minutes 1
with 1
his 1
brows 1
knitted 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
upon 1
the 1
fire 1
Do 1
you 1
receive 1
much 1
company 1
he 1
asked 1
None 1
save 1
my 1
partner 1
with 1
his 1
family 1
and 1
an 1
occasional 1
friend 1
of 1
Arthur 1
s 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
has 1
been 1
several 1
times 1
lately 1
No 1
one 1
else 1
I 1
think 1
Do 1
you 1
go 1
out 1
much 1
in 1
society 1
Arthur 1
does 1
Mary 1
and 1
I 1
stay 1
at 1
home 1
We 1
neither 1
of 1
us 1
care 1
for 1
it 1
That 1
is 1
unusual 1
in 1
a 1
young 1
girl 1
She 1
is 1
of 1
a 1
quiet 1
nature 1
Besides 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
so 1
very 1
young 1
She 1
is 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
This 1
matter 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
say 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
shock 1
to 1
her 1
also 1
Terrible 1
She 1
is 1
even 1
more 1
affected 1
than 1
I 1
You 1
have 1
neither 1
of 1
you 1
any 1
doubt 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
son 1
s 1
guilt 1
How 1
can 1
we 1
have 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
him 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
I 1
hardly 1
consider 1
that 1
a 1
conclusive 1
proof 1
Was 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
at 1
all 1
injured 1
Yes 1
it 1
was 1
twisted 1
Do 1
you 1
not 1
think 1
then 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
trying 1
to 1
straighten 1
it 1
God 1
bless 1
you 1
You 1
are 1
doing 1
what 1
you 1
can 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
for 1
me 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
too 1
heavy 1
a 1
task 1
What 1
was 1
he 1
doing 1
there 1
at 1
all 1
If 1
his 1
purpose 1
were 1
innocent 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
not 1
say 1
so 1
Precisely 1
And 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
guilty 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
not 1
invent 1
a 1
lie 1
His 1
silence 1
appears 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
cut 1
both 1
ways 1
There 1
are 1
several 1
singular 1
points 1
about 1
the 1
case 1
What 1
did 1
the 1
police 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
noise 1
which 1
awoke 1
you 1
from 1
your 1
sleep 1
They 1
considered 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
caused 1
by 1
Arthur 1
s 1
closing 1
his 1
bedroom 1
door 1
A 1
likely 1
story 1
As 1
if 1
a 1
man 1
bent 1
on 1
felony 1
would 1
slam 1
his 1
door 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
wake 1
a 1
household 1
What 1
did 1
they 1
say 1
then 1
of 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
these 1
gems 1
They 1
are 1
still 1
sounding 1
the 1
planking 1
and 1
probing 1
the 1
furniture 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
finding 1
them 1
Have 1
they 1
thought 1
of 1
looking 1
outside 1
the 1
house 1
Yes 1
they 1
have 1
shown 1
extraordinary 1
energy 1
The 1
whole 1
garden 1
has 1
already 1
been 1
minutely 1
examined 1
Now 1
my 1
dear 1
sir 1
said 1
Holmes 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
obvious 1
to 1
you 1
now 1
that 1
this 1
matter 1
really 1
strikes 1
very 1
much 1
deeper 1
than 1
either 1
you 1
or 1
the 1
police 1
were 1
at 1
first 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
It 1
appeared 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
simple 1
case 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
seems 1
exceedingly 1
complex 1
Consider 1
what 1
is 1
involved 1
by 1
your 1
theory 1
You 1
suppose 1
that 1
your 1
son 1
came 1
down 1
from 1
his 1
bed 1
went 1
at 1
great 1
risk 1
to 1
your 1
dressing 1
room 1
opened 1
your 1
bureau 1
took 1
out 1
your 1
coronet 1
broke 1
off 1
by 1
main 1
force 1
a 1
small 1
portion 1
of 1
it 1
went 1
off 1
to 1
some 1
other 1
place 1
concealed 1
three 1
gems 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
thirty 1
nine 1
with 1
such 1
skill 1
that 1
nobody 1
can 1
find 1
them 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
thirty 1
six 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
exposed 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
greatest 1
danger 1
of 1
being 1
discovered 1
I 1
ask 1
you 1
now 1
is 1
such 1
a 1
theory 1
tenable 1
But 1
what 1
other 1
is 1
there 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
with 1
a 1
gesture 1
of 1
despair 1
If 1
his 1
motives 1
were 1
innocent 1
why 1
does 1
he 1
not 1
explain 1
them 1
It 1
is 1
our 1
task 1
to 1
find 1
that 1
out 1
replied 1
Holmes 1
so 1
now 1
if 1
you 1
please 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
we 1
will 1
set 1
off 1
for 1
Streatham 1
together 1
and 1
devote 1
an 1
hour 1
to 1
glancing 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
closely 1
into 1
details 1
My 1
friend 1
insisted 1
upon 1
my 1
accompanying 1
them 1
in 1
their 1
expedition 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
eager 1
enough 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
my 1
curiosity 1
and 1
sympathy 1
were 1
deeply 1
stirred 1
by 1
the 1
story 1
to 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
listened 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
the 1
guilt 1
of 1
the 1
banker 1
s 1
son 1
appeared 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
as 1
obvious 1
as 1
it 1
did 1
to 1
his 1
unhappy 1
father 1
but 1
still 1
I 1
had 1
such 1
faith 1
in 1
Holmes 1
judgment 1
that 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
grounds 1
for 1
hope 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
dissatisfied 1
with 1
the 1
accepted 1
explanation 1
He 1
hardly 1
spoke 1
a 1
word 1
the 1
whole 1
way 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
southern 1
suburb 1
but 1
sat 1
with 1
his 1
chin 1
upon 1
his 1
breast 1
and 1
his 1
hat 1
drawn 1
over 1
his 1
eyes 1
sunk 1
in 1
the 1
deepest 1
thought 1
Our 1
client 1
appeared 1
to 1
have 1
taken 1
fresh 1
heart 1
at 1
the 1
little 1
glimpse 1
of 1
hope 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
presented 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
he 1
even 1
broke 1
into 1
a 1
desultory 1
chat 1
with 1
me 1
over 1
his 1
business 1
affairs 1
A 1
short 1
railway 1
journey 1
and 1
a 1
shorter 1
walk 1
brought 1
us 1
to 1
Fairbank 1
the 1
modest 1
residence 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
financier 1
Fairbank 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
sized 1
square 1
house 1
of 1
white 1
stone 1
standing 1
back 1
a 1
little 1
from 1
the 1
road 1
A 1
double 1
carriage 1
sweep 1
with 1
a 1
snow 1
clad 1
lawn 1
stretched 1
down 1
in 1
front 1
to 1
two 1
large 1
iron 1
gates 1
which 1
closed 1
the 1
entrance 1
On 1
the 1
right 1
side 1
was 1
a 1
small 1
wooden 1
thicket 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
a 1
narrow 1
path 1
between 1
two 1
neat 1
hedges 1
stretching 1
from 1
the 1
road 1
to 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
and 1
forming 1
the 1
tradesmen 1
s 1
entrance 1
On 1
the 1
left 1
ran 1
a 1
lane 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
stables 1
and 1
was 1
not 1
itself 1
within 1
the 1
grounds 1
at 1
all 1
being 1
a 1
public 1
though 1
little 1
used 1
thoroughfare 1
Holmes 1
left 1
us 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
walked 1
slowly 1
all 1
round 1
the 1
house 1
across 1
the 1
front 1
down 1
the 1
tradesmen 1
s 1
path 1
and 1
so 1
round 1
by 1
the 1
garden 1
behind 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
So 1
long 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
and 1
I 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
dining 1
room 1
and 1
waited 1
by 1
the 1
fire 1
until 1
he 1
should 1
return 1
We 1
were 1
sitting 1
there 1
in 1
silence 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
came 1
in 1
She 1
was 1
rather 1
above 1
the 1
middle 1
height 1
slim 1
with 1
dark 1
hair 1
and 1
eyes 1
which 1
seemed 1
the 1
darker 1
against 1
the 1
absolute 1
pallor 1
of 1
her 1
skin 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
such 1
deadly 1
paleness 1
in 1
a 1
woman 1
s 1
face 1
Her 1
lips 1
too 1
were 1
bloodless 1
but 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
flushed 1
with 1
crying 1
As 1
she 1
swept 1
silently 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
she 1
impressed 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
greater 1
sense 1
of 1
grief 1
than 1
the 1
banker 1
had 1
done 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
more 1
striking 1
in 1
her 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
evidently 1
a 1
woman 1
of 1
strong 1
character 1
with 1
immense 1
capacity 1
for 1
self 1
restraint 1
Disregarding 1
my 1
presence 1
she 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
her 1
uncle 1
and 1
passed 1
her 1
hand 1
over 1
his 1
head 1
with 1
a 1
sweet 1
womanly 1
caress 1
You 1
have 1
given 1
orders 1
that 1
Arthur 1
should 1
be 1
liberated 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
dad 1
she 1
asked 1
No 1
no 1
my 1
girl 1
the 1
matter 1
must 1
be 1
probed 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
But 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
sure 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
You 1
know 1
what 1
woman 1
s 1
instincts 1
are 1
I 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
no 1
harm 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
sorry 1
for 1
having 1
acted 1
so 1
harshly 1
Why 1
is 1
he 1
silent 1
then 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
Who 1
knows 1
Perhaps 1
because 1
he 1
was 1
so 1
angry 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
suspect 1
him 1
How 1
could 1
I 1
help 1
suspecting 1
him 1
when 1
I 1
actually 1
saw 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Oh 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
only 1
picked 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
Oh 1
do 1
do 1
take 1
my 1
word 1
for 1
it 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
innocent 1
Let 1
the 1
matter 1
drop 1
and 1
say 1
no 1
more 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
dreadful 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
our 1
dear 1
Arthur 1
in 1
prison 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
let 1
it 1
drop 1
until 1
the 1
gems 1
are 1
found 1
never 1
Mary 1
Your 1
affection 1
for 1
Arthur 1
blinds 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
awful 1
consequences 1
to 1
me 1
Far 1
from 1
hushing 1
the 1
thing 1
up 1
I 1
have 1
brought 1
a 1
gentleman 1
down 1
from 1
London 1
to 1
inquire 1
more 1
deeply 1
into 1
it 1
This 1
gentleman 1
she 1
asked 1
facing 1
round 1
to 1
me 1
No 1
his 1
friend 1
He 1
wished 1
us 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
alone 1
He 1
is 1
round 1
in 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
now 1
The 1
stable 1
lane 1
She 1
raised 1
her 1
dark 1
eyebrows 1
What 1
can 1
he 1
hope 1
to 1
find 1
there 1
Ah 1
this 1
I 1
suppose 1
is 1
he 1
I 1
trust 1
sir 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
succeed 1
in 1
proving 1
what 1
I 1
feel 1
sure 1
is 1
the 1
truth 1
that 1
my 1
cousin 1
Arthur 1
is 1
innocent 1
of 1
this 1
crime 1
I 1
fully 1
share 1
your 1
opinion 1
and 1
I 1
trust 1
with 1
you 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
prove 1
it 1
returned 1
Holmes 1
going 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
mat 1
to 1
knock 1
the 1
snow 1
from 1
his 1
shoes 1
I 1
believe 1
I 1
have 1
the 1
honour 1
of 1
addressing 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Holder 1
Might 1
I 1
ask 1
you 1
a 1
question 1
or 1
two 1
Pray 1
do 1
sir 1
if 1
it 1
may 1
help 1
to 1
clear 1
this 1
horrible 1
affair 1
up 1
You 1
heard 1
nothing 1
yourself 1
last 1
night 1
Nothing 1
until 1
my 1
uncle 1
here 1
began 1
to 1
speak 1
loudly 1
I 1
heard 1
that 1
and 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
You 1
shut 1
up 1
the 1
windows 1
and 1
doors 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
Did 1
you 1
fasten 1
all 1
the 1
windows 1
Yes 1
Were 1
they 1
all 1
fastened 1
this 1
morning 1
Yes 1
You 1
have 1
a 1
maid 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
sweetheart 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
remarked 1
to 1
your 1
uncle 1
last 1
night 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
him 1
Yes 1
and 1
she 1
was 1
the 1
girl 1
who 1
waited 1
in 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
and 1
who 1
may 1
have 1
heard 1
uncle 1
s 1
remarks 1
about 1
the 1
coronet 1
I 1
see 1
You 1
infer 1
that 1
she 1
may 1
have 1
gone 1
out 1
to 1
tell 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
may 1
have 1
planned 1
the 1
robbery 1
But 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
all 1
these 1
vague 1
theories 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
impatiently 1
when 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
I 1
saw 1
Arthur 1
with 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
Wait 1
a 1
little 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
We 1
must 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
that 1
About 1
this 1
girl 1
Miss 1
Holder 1
You 1
saw 1
her 1
return 1
by 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
I 1
presume 1
Yes 1
when 1
I 1
went 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
fastened 1
for 1
the 1
night 1
I 1
met 1
her 1
slipping 1
in 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
man 1
too 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
him 1
Oh 1
yes 1
he 1
is 1
the 1
green 1
grocer 1
who 1
brings 1
our 1
vegetables 1
round 1
His 1
name 1
is 1
Francis 1
Prosper 1
He 1
stood 1
said 1
Holmes 1
to 1
the 1
left 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
that 1
is 1
to 1
say 1
farther 1
up 1
the 1
path 1
than 1
is 1
necessary 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
door 1
Yes 1
he 1
did 1
And 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
wooden 1
leg 1
Something 1
like 1
fear 1
sprang 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
s 1
expressive 1
black 1
eyes 1
Why 1
you 1
are 1
like 1
a 1
magician 1
said 1
she 1
How 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
She 1
smiled 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
answering 1
smile 1
in 1
Holmes 1
thin 1
eager 1
face 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
now 1
to 1
go 1
upstairs 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
shall 1
probably 1
wish 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
again 1
Perhaps 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
take 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
lower 1
windows 1
before 1
I 1
go 1
up 1
He 1
walked 1
swiftly 1
round 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
pausing 1
only 1
at 1
the 1
large 1
one 1
which 1
looked 1
from 1
the 1
hall 1
onto 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
This 1
he 1
opened 1
and 1
made 1
a 1
very 1
careful 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
sill 1
with 1
his 1
powerful 1
magnifying 1
lens 1
Now 1
we 1
shall 1
go 1
upstairs 1
said 1
he 1
at 1
last 1
The 1
banker 1
s 1
dressing 1
room 1
was 1
a 1
plainly 1
furnished 1
little 1
chamber 1
with 1
a 1
grey 1
carpet 1
a 1
large 1
bureau 1
and 1
a 1
long 1
mirror 1
Holmes 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
bureau 1
first 1
and 1
looked 1
hard 1
at 1
the 1
lock 1
Which 1
key 1
was 1
used 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
he 1
asked 1
That 1
which 1
my 1
son 1
himself 1
indicated 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
cupboard 1
of 1
the 1
lumber 1
room 1
Have 1
you 1
it 1
here 1
That 1
is 1
it 1
on 1
the 1
dressing 1
table 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
bureau 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
noiseless 1
lock 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
is 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
it 1
did 1
not 1
wake 1
you 1
This 1
case 1
I 1
presume 1
contains 1
the 1
coronet 1
We 1
must 1
have 1
a 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
case 1
and 1
taking 1
out 1
the 1
diadem 1
he 1
laid 1
it 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
magnificent 1
specimen 1
of 1
the 1
jeweller 1
s 1
art 1
and 1
the 1
thirty 1
six 1
stones 1
were 1
the 1
finest 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
seen 1
At 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
was 1
a 1
cracked 1
edge 1
where 1
a 1
corner 1
holding 1
three 1
gems 1
had 1
been 1
torn 1
away 1
Now 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
said 1
Holmes 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
corner 1
which 1
corresponds 1
to 1
that 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
unfortunately 1
lost 1
Might 1
I 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
break 1
it 1
off 1
The 1
banker 1
recoiled 1
in 1
horror 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
trying 1
said 1
he 1
Then 1
I 1
will 1
Holmes 1
suddenly 1
bent 1
his 1
strength 1
upon 1
it 1
but 1
without 1
result 1
I 1
feel 1
it 1
give 1
a 1
little 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
though 1
I 1
am 1
exceptionally 1
strong 1
in 1
the 1
fingers 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
me 1
all 1
my 1
time 1
to 1
break 1
it 1
An 1
ordinary 1
man 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
it 1
Now 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
would 1
happen 1
if 1
I 1
did 1
break 1
it 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
There 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
noise 1
like 1
a 1
pistol 1
shot 1
Do 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
all 1
this 1
happened 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
of 1
your 1
bed 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
heard 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
think 1
It 1
is 1
all 1
dark 1
to 1
me 1
But 1
perhaps 1
it 1
may 1
grow 1
lighter 1
as 1
we 1
go 1
What 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
Miss 1
Holder 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
still 1
share 1
my 1
uncle 1
s 1
perplexity 1
Your 1
son 1
had 1
no 1
shoes 1
or 1
slippers 1
on 1
when 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
He 1
had 1
nothing 1
on 1
save 1
only 1
his 1
trousers 1
and 1
shirt 1
Thank 1
you 1
We 1
have 1
certainly 1
been 1
favoured 1
with 1
extraordinary 1
luck 1
during 1
this 1
inquiry 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
entirely 1
our 1
own 1
fault 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
succeed 1
in 1
clearing 1
the 1
matter 1
up 1
With 1
your 1
permission 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
I 1
shall 1
now 1
continue 1
my 1
investigations 1
outside 1
He 1
went 1
alone 1
at 1
his 1
own 1
request 1
for 1
he 1
explained 1
that 1
any 1
unnecessary 1
footmarks 1
might 1
make 1
his 1
task 1
more 1
difficult 1
For 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
more 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
work 1
returning 1
at 1
last 1
with 1
his 1
feet 1
heavy 1
with 1
snow 1
and 1
his 1
features 1
as 1
inscrutable 1
as 1
ever 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
now 1
all 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
see 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
can 1
serve 1
you 1
best 1
by 1
returning 1
to 1
my 1
rooms 1
But 1
the 1
gems 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Where 1
are 1
they 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
The 1
banker 1
wrung 1
his 1
hands 1
I 1
shall 1
never 1
see 1
them 1
again 1
he 1
cried 1
And 1
my 1
son 1
You 1
give 1
me 1
hopes 1
My 1
opinion 1
is 1
in 1
no 1
way 1
altered 1
Then 1
for 1
God 1
s 1
sake 1
what 1
was 1
this 1
dark 1
business 1
which 1
was 1
acted 1
in 1
my 1
house 1
last 1
night 1
If 1
you 1
can 1
call 1
upon 1
me 1
at 1
my 1
Baker 1
Street 1
rooms 1
to 1
morrow 1
morning 1
between 1
nine 1
and 1
ten 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
I 1
can 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
clearer 1
I 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
give 1
me 1
carte 1
blanche 1
to 1
act 1
for 1
you 1
provided 1
only 1
that 1
I 1
get 1
back 1
the 1
gems 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
place 1
no 1
limit 1
on 1
the 1
sum 1
I 1
may 1
draw 1
I 1
would 1
give 1
my 1
fortune 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
back 1
Very 1
good 1
I 1
shall 1
look 1
into 1
the 1
matter 1
between 1
this 1
and 1
then 1
Good 1
bye 1
it 1
is 1
just 1
possible 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
have 1
to 1
come 1
over 1
here 1
again 1
before 1
evening 1
It 1
was 1
obvious 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
my 1
companion 1
s 1
mind 1
was 1
now 1
made 1
up 1
about 1
the 1
case 1
although 1
what 1
his 1
conclusions 1
were 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
could 1
even 1
dimly 1
imagine 1
Several 1
times 1
during 1
our 1
homeward 1
journey 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
sound 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
point 1
but 1
he 1
always 1
glided 1
away 1
to 1
some 1
other 1
topic 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
I 1
gave 1
it 1
over 1
in 1
despair 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
yet 1
three 1
when 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
our 1
rooms 1
once 1
more 1
He 1
hurried 1
to 1
his 1
chamber 1
and 1
was 1
down 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
dressed 1
as 1
a 1
common 1
loafer 1
With 1
his 1
collar 1
turned 1
up 1
his 1
shiny 1
seedy 1
coat 1
his 1
red 1
cravat 1
and 1
his 1
worn 1
boots 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
perfect 1
sample 1
of 1
the 1
class 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
should 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
glancing 1
into 1
the 1
glass 1
above 1
the 1
fireplace 1
I 1
only 1
wish 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
Watson 1
but 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
it 1
won 1
t 1
do 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
on 1
the 1
trail 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
or 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
following 1
a 1
will 1
o 1
the 1
wisp 1
but 1
I 1
shall 1
soon 1
know 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
I 1
may 1
be 1
back 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
hours 1
He 1
cut 1
a 1
slice 1
of 1
beef 1
from 1
the 1
joint 1
upon 1
the 1
sideboard 1
sandwiched 1
it 1
between 1
two 1
rounds 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
thrusting 1
this 1
rude 1
meal 1
into 1
his 1
pocket 1
he 1
started 1
off 1
upon 1
his 1
expedition 1
I 1
had 1
just 1
finished 1
my 1
tea 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
evidently 1
in 1
excellent 1
spirits 1
swinging 1
an 1
old 1
elastic 1
sided 1
boot 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
He 1
chucked 1
it 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
corner 1
and 1
helped 1
himself 1
to 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
tea 1
I 1
only 1
looked 1
in 1
as 1
I 1
passed 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
am 1
going 1
right 1
on 1
Where 1
to 1
Oh 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
West 1
End 1
It 1
may 1
be 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
I 1
get 1
back 1
Don 1
t 1
wait 1
up 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
case 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
late 1
How 1
are 1
you 1
getting 1
on 1
Oh 1
so 1
so 1
Nothing 1
to 1
complain 1
of 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
out 1
to 1
Streatham 1
since 1
I 1
saw 1
you 1
last 1
but 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
call 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
sweet 1
little 1
problem 1
and 1
I 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
missed 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
However 1
I 1
must 1
not 1
sit 1
gossiping 1
here 1
but 1
must 1
get 1
these 1
disreputable 1
clothes 1
off 1
and 1
return 1
to 1
my 1
highly 1
respectable 1
self 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
his 1
manner 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
stronger 1
reasons 1
for 1
satisfaction 1
than 1
his 1
words 1
alone 1
would 1
imply 1
His 1
eyes 1
twinkled 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
even 1
a 1
touch 1
of 1
colour 1
upon 1
his 1
sallow 1
cheeks 1
He 1
hastened 1
upstairs 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
slam 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
which 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
off 1
once 1
more 1
upon 1
his 1
congenial 1
hunt 1
I 1
waited 1
until 1
midnight 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
his 1
return 1
so 1
I 1
retired 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
It 1
was 1
no 1
uncommon 1
thing 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
away 1
for 1
days 1
and 1
nights 1
on 1
end 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
hot 1
upon 1
a 1
scent 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
lateness 1
caused 1
me 1
no 1
surprise 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
at 1
what 1
hour 1
he 1
came 1
in 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
there 1
he 1
was 1
with 1
a 1
cup 1
of 1
coffee 1
in 1
one 1
hand 1
and 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
as 1
fresh 1
and 1
trim 1
as 1
possible 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
beginning 1
without 1
you 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
but 1
you 1
remember 1
that 1
our 1
client 1
has 1
rather 1
an 1
early 1
appointment 1
this 1
morning 1
Why 1
it 1
is 1
after 1
nine 1
now 1
I 1
answered 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
surprised 1
if 1
that 1
were 1
he 1
I 1
thought 1
I 1
heard 1
a 1
ring 1
It 1
was 1
indeed 1
our 1
friend 1
the 1
financier 1
I 1
was 1
shocked 1
by 1
the 1
change 1
which 1
had 1
come 1
over 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
face 1
which 1
was 1
naturally 1
of 1
a 1
broad 1
and 1
massive 1
mould 1
was 1
now 1
pinched 1
and 1
fallen 1
in 1
while 1
his 1
hair 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
shade 1
whiter 1
He 1
entered 1
with 1
a 1
weariness 1
and 1
lethargy 1
which 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
painful 1
than 1
his 1
violence 1
of 1
the 1
morning 1
before 1
and 1
he 1
dropped 1
heavily 1
into 1
the 1
armchair 1
which 1
I 1
pushed 1
forward 1
for 1
him 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
severely 1
tried 1
said 1
he 1
Only 1
two 1
days 1
ago 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
happy 1
and 1
prosperous 1
man 1
without 1
a 1
care 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
Now 1
I 1
am 1
left 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
and 1
dishonoured 1
age 1
One 1
sorrow 1
comes 1
close 1
upon 1
the 1
heels 1
of 1
another 1
My 1
niece 1
Mary 1
has 1
deserted 1
me 1
Deserted 1
you 1
Yes 1
Her 1
bed 1
this 1
morning 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
slept 1
in 1
her 1
room 1
was 1
empty 1
and 1
a 1
note 1
for 1
me 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
hall 1
table 1
I 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
last 1
night 1
in 1
sorrow 1
and 1
not 1
in 1
anger 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
married 1
my 1
boy 1
all 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
well 1
with 1
him 1
Perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
thoughtless 1
of 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
so 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
that 1
remark 1
that 1
she 1
refers 1
in 1
this 1
note 1
MY 1
DEAREST 1
UNCLE 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
brought 1
trouble 1
upon 1
you 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
acted 1
differently 1
this 1
terrible 1
misfortune 1
might 1
never 1
have 1
occurred 1
I 1
cannot 1
with 1
this 1
thought 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
ever 1
again 1
be 1
happy 1
under 1
your 1
roof 1
and 1
I 1
feel 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
forever 1
Do 1
not 1
worry 1
about 1
my 1
future 1
for 1
that 1
is 1
provided 1
for 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
do 1
not 1
search 1
for 1
me 1
for 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
fruitless 1
labour 1
and 1
an 1
ill 1
service 1
to 1
me 1
In 1
life 1
or 1
in 1
death 1
I 1
am 1
ever 1
your 1
loving 1
MARY 1
What 1
could 1
she 1
mean 1
by 1
that 1
note 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
points 1
to 1
suicide 1
No 1
no 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
It 1
is 1
perhaps 1
the 1
best 1
possible 1
solution 1
I 1
trust 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
nearing 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
your 1
troubles 1
Ha 1
You 1
say 1
so 1
You 1
have 1
heard 1
something 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
you 1
have 1
learned 1
something 1
Where 1
are 1
the 1
gems 1
You 1
would 1
not 1
think 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
an 1
excessive 1
sum 1
for 1
them 1
I 1
would 1
pay 1
ten 1
That 1
would 1
be 1
unnecessary 1
Three 1
thousand 1
will 1
cover 1
the 1
matter 1
And 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
reward 1
I 1
fancy 1
Have 1
you 1
your 1
check 1
book 1
Here 1
is 1
a 1
pen 1
Better 1
make 1
it 1
out 1
for 1
pounds 1
With 1
a 1
dazed 1
face 1
the 1
banker 1
made 1
out 1
the 1
required 1
check 1
Holmes 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
his 1
desk 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
little 1
triangular 1
piece 1
of 1
gold 1
with 1
three 1
gems 1
in 1
it 1
and 1
threw 1
it 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
With 1
a 1
shriek 1
of 1
joy 1
our 1
client 1
clutched 1
it 1
up 1
You 1
have 1
it 1
he 1
gasped 1
I 1
am 1
saved 1
I 1
am 1
saved 1
The 1
reaction 1
of 1
joy 1
was 1
as 1
passionate 1
as 1
his 1
grief 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
he 1
hugged 1
his 1
recovered 1
gems 1
to 1
his 1
bosom 1
There 1
is 1
one 1
other 1
thing 1
you 1
owe 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
said 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
rather 1
sternly 1
Owe 1
He 1
caught 1
up 1
a 1
pen 1
Name 1
the 1
sum 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
pay 1
it 1
No 1
the 1
debt 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
me 1
You 1
owe 1
a 1
very 1
humble 1
apology 1
to 1
that 1
noble 1
lad 1
your 1
son 1
who 1
has 1
carried 1
himself 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
proud 1
to 1
see 1
my 1
own 1
son 1
do 1
should 1
I 1
ever 1
chance 1
to 1
have 1
one 1
Then 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
Arthur 1
who 1
took 1
them 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
yesterday 1
and 1
I 1
repeat 1
to 1
day 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
You 1
are 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
Then 1
let 1
us 1
hurry 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
known 1
He 1
knows 1
it 1
already 1
When 1
I 1
had 1
cleared 1
it 1
all 1
up 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
him 1
and 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
story 1
I 1
told 1
it 1
to 1
him 1
on 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
to 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
to 1
add 1
the 1
very 1
few 1
details 1
which 1
were 1
not 1
yet 1
quite 1
clear 1
to 1
me 1
Your 1
news 1
of 1
this 1
morning 1
however 1
may 1
open 1
his 1
lips 1
For 1
heaven 1
s 1
sake 1
tell 1
me 1
then 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
mystery 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
the 1
steps 1
by 1
which 1
I 1
reached 1
it 1
And 1
let 1
me 1
say 1
to 1
you 1
first 1
that 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
hardest 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
say 1
and 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
hear 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
understanding 1
between 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
and 1
your 1
niece 1
Mary 1
They 1
have 1
now 1
fled 1
together 1
My 1
Mary 1
Impossible 1
It 1
is 1
unfortunately 1
more 1
than 1
possible 1
it 1
is 1
certain 1
Neither 1
you 1
nor 1
your 1
son 1
knew 1
the 1
true 1
character 1
of 1
this 1
man 1
when 1
you 1
admitted 1
him 1
into 1
your 1
family 1
circle 1
He 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
dangerous 1
men 1
in 1
England 1
a 1
ruined 1
gambler 1
an 1
absolutely 1
desperate 1
villain 1
a 1
man 1
without 1
heart 1
or 1
conscience 1
Your 1
niece 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
such 1
men 1
When 1
he 1
breathed 1
his 1
vows 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
to 1
a 1
hundred 1
before 1
her 1
she 1
flattered 1
herself 1
that 1
she 1
alone 1
had 1
touched 1
his 1
heart 1
The 1
devil 1
knows 1
best 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
but 1
at 1
least 1
she 1
became 1
his 1
tool 1
and 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
seeing 1
him 1
nearly 1
every 1
evening 1
I 1
cannot 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
not 1
believe 1
it 1
cried 1
the 1
banker 1
with 1
an 1
ashen 1
face 1
I 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
then 1
what 1
occurred 1
in 1
your 1
house 1
last 1
night 1
Your 1
niece 1
when 1
you 1
had 1
as 1
she 1
thought 1
gone 1
to 1
your 1
room 1
slipped 1
down 1
and 1
talked 1
to 1
her 1
lover 1
through 1
the 1
window 1
which 1
leads 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
His 1
footmarks 1
had 1
pressed 1
right 1
through 1
the 1
snow 1
so 1
long 1
had 1
he 1
stood 1
there 1
She 1
told 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
His 1
wicked 1
lust 1
for 1
gold 1
kindled 1
at 1
the 1
news 1
and 1
he 1
bent 1
her 1
to 1
his 1
will 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
she 1
loved 1
you 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
women 1
in 1
whom 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
a 1
lover 1
extinguishes 1
all 1
other 1
loves 1
and 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
she 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
one 1
She 1
had 1
hardly 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
instructions 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
you 1
coming 1
downstairs 1
on 1
which 1
she 1
closed 1
the 1
window 1
rapidly 1
and 1
told 1
you 1
about 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
escapade 1
with 1
her 1
wooden 1
legged 1
lover 1
which 1
was 1
all 1
perfectly 1
true 1
Your 1
boy 1
Arthur 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
after 1
his 1
interview 1
with 1
you 1
but 1
he 1
slept 1
badly 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
his 1
uneasiness 1
about 1
his 1
club 1
debts 1
In 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
he 1
heard 1
a 1
soft 1
tread 1
pass 1
his 1
door 1
so 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
looking 1
out 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
his 1
cousin 1
walking 1
very 1
stealthily 1
along 1
the 1
passage 1
until 1
she 1
disappeared 1
into 1
your 1
dressing 1
room 1
Petrified 1
with 1
astonishment 1
the 1
lad 1
slipped 1
on 1
some 1
clothes 1
and 1
waited 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
would 1
come 1
of 1
this 1
strange 1
affair 1
Presently 1
she 1
emerged 1
from 1
the 1
room 1
again 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
passage 1
lamp 1
your 1
son 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
carried 1
the 1
precious 1
coronet 1
in 1
her 1
hands 1
She 1
passed 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
he 1
thrilling 1
with 1
horror 1
ran 1
along 1
and 1
slipped 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
near 1
your 1
door 1
whence 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
what 1
passed 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
beneath 1
He 1
saw 1
her 1
stealthily 1
open 1
the 1
window 1
hand 1
out 1
the 1
coronet 1
to 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
gloom 1
and 1
then 1
closing 1
it 1
once 1
more 1
hurry 1
back 1
to 1
her 1
room 1
passing 1
quite 1
close 1
to 1
where 1
he 1
stood 1
hid 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
As 1
long 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
scene 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
any 1
action 1
without 1
a 1
horrible 1
exposure 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
whom 1
he 1
loved 1
But 1
the 1
instant 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
gone 1
he 1
realised 1
how 1
crushing 1
a 1
misfortune 1
this 1
would 1
be 1
for 1
you 1
and 1
how 1
all 1
important 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
set 1
it 1
right 1
He 1
rushed 1
down 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
his 1
bare 1
feet 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
sprang 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
snow 1
and 1
ran 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
dark 1
figure 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
but 1
Arthur 1
caught 1
him 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
struggle 1
between 1
them 1
your 1
lad 1
tugging 1
at 1
one 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
coronet 1
and 1
his 1
opponent 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
In 1
the 1
scuffle 1
your 1
son 1
struck 1
Sir 1
George 1
and 1
cut 1
him 1
over 1
the 1
eye 1
Then 1
something 1
suddenly 1
snapped 1
and 1
your 1
son 1
finding 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
coronet 1
in 1
his 1
hands 1
rushed 1
back 1
closed 1
the 1
window 1
ascended 1
to 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
had 1
just 1
observed 1
that 1
the 1
coronet 1
had 1
been 1
twisted 1
in 1
the 1
struggle 1
and 1
was 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
straighten 1
it 1
when 1
you 1
appeared 1
upon 1
the 1
scene 1
Is 1
it 1
possible 1
gasped 1
the 1
banker 1
You 1
then 1
roused 1
his 1
anger 1
by 1
calling 1
him 1
names 1
at 1
a 1
moment 1
when 1
he 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
deserved 1
your 1
warmest 1
thanks 1
He 1
could 1
not 1
explain 1
the 1
true 1
state 1
of 1
affairs 1
without 1
betraying 1
one 1
who 1
certainly 1
deserved 1
little 1
enough 1
consideration 1
at 1
his 1
hands 1
He 1
took 1
the 1
more 1
chivalrous 1
view 1
however 1
and 1
preserved 1
her 1
secret 1
And 1
that 1
was 1
why 1
she 1
shrieked 1
and 1
fainted 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
the 1
coronet 1
cried 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
Oh 1
my 1
God 1
what 1
a 1
blind 1
fool 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
And 1
his 1
asking 1
to 1
be 1
allowed 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
for 1
five 1
minutes 1
The 1
dear 1
fellow 1
wanted 1
to 1
see 1
if 1
the 1
missing 1
piece 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
struggle 1
How 1
cruelly 1
I 1
have 1
misjudged 1
him 1
When 1
I 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
house 1
continued 1
Holmes 1
I 1
at 1
once 1
went 1
very 1
carefully 1
round 1
it 1
to 1
observe 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
traces 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
which 1
might 1
help 1
me 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
none 1
had 1
fallen 1
since 1
the 1
evening 1
before 1
and 1
also 1
that 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
strong 1
frost 1
to 1
preserve 1
impressions 1
I 1
passed 1
along 1
the 1
tradesmen 1
s 1
path 1
but 1
found 1
it 1
all 1
trampled 1
down 1
and 1
indistinguishable 1
Just 1
beyond 1
it 1
however 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
a 1
woman 1
had 1
stood 1
and 1
talked 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
whose 1
round 1
impressions 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
wooden 1
leg 1
I 1
could 1
even 1
tell 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
been 1
disturbed 1
for 1
the 1
woman 1
had 1
run 1
back 1
swiftly 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
as 1
was 1
shown 1
by 1
the 1
deep 1
toe 1
and 1
light 1
heel 1
marks 1
while 1
Wooden 1
leg 1
had 1
waited 1
a 1
little 1
and 1
then 1
had 1
gone 1
away 1
I 1
thought 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
this 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
maid 1
and 1
her 1
sweetheart 1
of 1
whom 1
you 1
had 1
already 1
spoken 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
inquiry 1
showed 1
it 1
was 1
so 1
I 1
passed 1
round 1
the 1
garden 1
without 1
seeing 1
anything 1
more 1
than 1
random 1
tracks 1
which 1
I 1
took 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
police 1
but 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
into 1
the 1
stable 1
lane 1
a 1
very 1
long 1
and 1
complex 1
story 1
was 1
written 1
in 1
the 1
snow 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
double 1
line 1
of 1
tracks 1
of 1
a 1
booted 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
second 1
double 1
line 1
which 1
I 1
saw 1
with 1
delight 1
belonged 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
naked 1
feet 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
once 1
convinced 1
from 1
what 1
you 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
latter 1
was 1
your 1
son 1
The 1
first 1
had 1
walked 1
both 1
ways 1
but 1
the 1
other 1
had 1
run 1
swiftly 1
and 1
as 1
his 1
tread 1
was 1
marked 1
in 1
places 1
over 1
the 1
depression 1
of 1
the 1
boot 1
it 1
was 1
obvious 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
after 1
the 1
other 1
I 1
followed 1
them 1
up 1
and 1
found 1
they 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
hall 1
window 1
where 1
Boots 1
had 1
worn 1
all 1
the 1
snow 1
away 1
while 1
waiting 1
Then 1
I 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
or 1
more 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
I 1
saw 1
where 1
Boots 1
had 1
faced 1
round 1
where 1
the 1
snow 1
was 1
cut 1
up 1
as 1
though 1
there 1
had 1
been 1
a 1
struggle 1
and 1
finally 1
where 1
a 1
few 1
drops 1
of 1
blood 1
had 1
fallen 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
mistaken 1
Boots 1
had 1
then 1
run 1
down 1
the 1
lane 1
and 1
another 1
little 1
smudge 1
of 1
blood 1
showed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
hurt 1
When 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
highroad 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
end 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
pavement 1
had 1
been 1
cleared 1
so 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
that 1
clue 1
On 1
entering 1
the 1
house 1
however 1
I 1
examined 1
as 1
you 1
remember 1
the 1
sill 1
and 1
framework 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
window 1
with 1
my 1
lens 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
at 1
once 1
see 1
that 1
someone 1
had 1
passed 1
out 1
I 1
could 1
distinguish 1
the 1
outline 1
of 1
an 1
instep 1
where 1
the 1
wet 1
foot 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
in 1
coming 1
in 1
I 1
was 1
then 1
beginning 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
form 1
an 1
opinion 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
had 1
occurred 1
A 1
man 1
had 1
waited 1
outside 1
the 1
window 1
someone 1
had 1
brought 1
the 1
gems 1
the 1
deed 1
had 1
been 1
overseen 1
by 1
your 1
son 1
he 1
had 1
pursued 1
the 1
thief 1
had 1
struggled 1
with 1
him 1
they 1
had 1
each 1
tugged 1
at 1
the 1
coronet 1
their 1
united 1
strength 1
causing 1
injuries 1
which 1
neither 1
alone 1
could 1
have 1
effected 1
He 1
had 1
returned 1
with 1
the 1
prize 1
but 1
had 1
left 1
a 1
fragment 1
in 1
the 1
grasp 1
of 1
his 1
opponent 1
So 1
far 1
I 1
was 1
clear 1
The 1
question 1
now 1
was 1
who 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
who 1
was 1
it 1
brought 1
him 1
the 1
coronet 1
It 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
maxim 1
of 1
mine 1
that 1
when 1
you 1
have 1
excluded 1
the 1
impossible 1
whatever 1
remains 1
however 1
improbable 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
truth 1
Now 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
you 1
who 1
had 1
brought 1
it 1
down 1
so 1
there 1
only 1
remained 1
your 1
niece 1
and 1
the 1
maids 1
But 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
maids 1
why 1
should 1
your 1
son 1
allow 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
accused 1
in 1
their 1
place 1
There 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
possible 1
reason 1
As 1
he 1
loved 1
his 1
cousin 1
however 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
excellent 1
explanation 1
why 1
he 1
should 1
retain 1
her 1
secret 1
the 1
more 1
so 1
as 1
the 1
secret 1
was 1
a 1
disgraceful 1
one 1
When 1
I 1
remembered 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
seen 1
her 1
at 1
that 1
window 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
fainted 1
on 1
seeing 1
the 1
coronet 1
again 1
my 1
conjecture 1
became 1
a 1
certainty 1
And 1
who 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
who 1
was 1
her 1
confederate 1
A 1
lover 1
evidently 1
for 1
who 1
else 1
could 1
outweigh 1
the 1
love 1
and 1
gratitude 1
which 1
she 1
must 1
feel 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
went 1
out 1
little 1
and 1
that 1
your 1
circle 1
of 1
friends 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
limited 1
one 1
But 1
among 1
them 1
was 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
I 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
before 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
evil 1
reputation 1
among 1
women 1
It 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
he 1
who 1
wore 1
those 1
boots 1
and 1
retained 1
the 1
missing 1
gems 1
Even 1
though 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
Arthur 1
had 1
discovered 1
him 1
he 1
might 1
still 1
flatter 1
himself 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
for 1
the 1
lad 1
could 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
without 1
compromising 1
his 1
own 1
family 1
Well 1
your 1
own 1
good 1
sense 1
will 1
suggest 1
what 1
measures 1
I 1
took 1
next 1
I 1
went 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
a 1
loafer 1
to 1
Sir 1
George 1
s 1
house 1
managed 1
to 1
pick 1
up 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
with 1
his 1
valet 1
learned 1
that 1
his 1
master 1
had 1
cut 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
and 1
finally 1
at 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
six 1
shillings 1
made 1
all 1
sure 1
by 1
buying 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
his 1
cast 1
off 1
shoes 1
With 1
these 1
I 1
journeyed 1
down 1
to 1
Streatham 1
and 1
saw 1
that 1
they 1
exactly 1
fitted 1
the 1
tracks 1
I 1
saw 1
an 1
ill 1
dressed 1
vagabond 1
in 1
the 1
lane 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
said 1
Mr 1
Holder 1
Precisely 1
It 1
was 1
I 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
my 1
man 1
so 1
I 1
came 1
home 1
and 1
changed 1
my 1
clothes 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
delicate 1
part 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
to 1
play 1
then 1
for 1
I 1
saw 1
that 1
a 1
prosecution 1
must 1
be 1
avoided 1
to 1
avert 1
scandal 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
so 1
astute 1
a 1
villain 1
would 1
see 1
that 1
our 1
hands 1
were 1
tied 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
went 1
and 1
saw 1
him 1
At 1
first 1
of 1
course 1
he 1
denied 1
everything 1
But 1
when 1
I 1
gave 1
him 1
every 1
particular 1
that 1
had 1
occurred 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
bluster 1
and 1
took 1
down 1
a 1
life 1
preserver 1
from 1
the 1
wall 1
I 1
knew 1
my 1
man 1
however 1
and 1
I 1
clapped 1
a 1
pistol 1
to 1
his 1
head 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
strike 1
Then 1
he 1
became 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
reasonable 1
I 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
we 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
price 1
for 1
the 1
stones 1
he 1
held 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
That 1
brought 1
out 1
the 1
first 1
signs 1
of 1
grief 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
shown 1
Why 1
dash 1
it 1
all 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
ve 1
let 1
them 1
go 1
at 1
six 1
hundred 1
for 1
the 1
three 1
I 1
soon 1
managed 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
address 1
of 1
the 1
receiver 1
who 1
had 1
them 1
on 1
promising 1
him 1
that 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
no 1
prosecution 1
Off 1
I 1
set 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
after 1
much 1
chaffering 1
I 1
got 1
our 1
stones 1
at 1
pounds 1
apiece 1
Then 1
I 1
looked 1
in 1
upon 1
your 1
son 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
right 1
and 1
eventually 1
got 1
to 1
my 1
bed 1
about 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
after 1
what 1
I 1
may 1
call 1
a 1
really 1
hard 1
day 1
s 1
work 1
A 1
day 1
which 1
has 1
saved 1
England 1
from 1
a 1
great 1
public 1
scandal 1
said 1
the 1
banker 1
rising 1
Sir 1
I 1
cannot 1
find 1
words 1
to 1
thank 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
shall 1
not 1
find 1
me 1
ungrateful 1
for 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
Your 1
skill 1
has 1
indeed 1
exceeded 1
all 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
heard 1
of 1
it 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
must 1
fly 1
to 1
my 1
dear 1
boy 1
to 1
apologise 1
to 1
him 1
for 1
the 1
wrong 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
him 1
As 1
to 1
what 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
of 1
poor 1
Mary 1
it 1
goes 1
to 1
my 1
very 1
heart 1
Not 1
even 1
your 1
skill 1
can 1
inform 1
me 1
where 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
safely 1
say 1
returned 1
Holmes 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
wherever 1
Sir 1
George 1
Burnwell 1
is 1
It 1
is 1
equally 1
certain 1
too 1
that 1
whatever 1
her 1
sins 1
are 1
they 1
will 1
soon 1
receive 1
a 1
more 1
than 1
sufficient 1
punishment 1
XII 1
THE 1
ADVENTURE 1
OF 1
THE 1
COPPER 1
BEECHES 1
To 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
loves 1
art 1
for 1
its 1
own 1
sake 1
remarked 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
tossing 1
aside 1
the 1
advertisement 1
sheet 1
of 1
the 1
Daily 1
Telegraph 1
it 1
is 1
frequently 1
in 1
its 1
least 1
important 1
and 1
lowliest 1
manifestations 1
that 1
the 1
keenest 1
pleasure 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
derived 1
It 1
is 1
pleasant 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
observe 1
Watson 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
far 1
grasped 1
this 1
truth 1
that 1
in 1
these 1
little 1
records 1
of 1
our 1
cases 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
draw 1
up 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
say 1
occasionally 1
to 1
embellish 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
prominence 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
to 1
the 1
many 1
causes 1
celebres 1
and 1
sensational 1
trials 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
figured 1
but 1
rather 1
to 1
those 1
incidents 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
trivial 1
in 1
themselves 1
but 1
which 1
have 1
given 1
room 1
for 1
those 1
faculties 1
of 1
deduction 1
and 1
of 1
logical 1
synthesis 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
my 1
special 1
province 1
And 1
yet 1
said 1
I 1
smiling 1
I 1
cannot 1
quite 1
hold 1
myself 1
absolved 1
from 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
sensationalism 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
urged 1
against 1
my 1
records 1
You 1
have 1
erred 1
perhaps 1
he 1
observed 1
taking 1
up 1
a 1
glowing 1
cinder 1
with 1
the 1
tongs 1
and 1
lighting 1
with 1
it 1
the 1
long 1
cherry 1
wood 1
pipe 1
which 1
was 1
wont 1
to 1
replace 1
his 1
clay 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
disputatious 1
rather 1
than 1
a 1
meditative 1
mood 1
you 1
have 1
erred 1
perhaps 1
in 1
attempting 1
to 1
put 1
colour 1
and 1
life 1
into 1
each 1
of 1
your 1
statements 1
instead 1
of 1
confining 1
yourself 1
to 1
the 1
task 1
of 1
placing 1
upon 1
record 1
that 1
severe 1
reasoning 1
from 1
cause 1
to 1
effect 1
which 1
is 1
really 1
the 1
only 1
notable 1
feature 1
about 1
the 1
thing 1
It 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
done 1
you 1
full 1
justice 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
I 1
remarked 1
with 1
some 1
coldness 1
for 1
I 1
was 1
repelled 1
by 1
the 1
egotism 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
observed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
strong 1
factor 1
in 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
singular 1
character 1
No 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
selfishness 1
or 1
conceit 1
said 1
he 1
answering 1
as 1
was 1
his 1
wont 1
my 1
thoughts 1
rather 1
than 1
my 1
words 1
If 1
I 1
claim 1
full 1
justice 1
for 1
my 1
art 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
impersonal 1
thing 1
a 1
thing 1
beyond 1
myself 1
Crime 1
is 1
common 1
Logic 1
is 1
rare 1
Therefore 1
it 1
is 1
upon 1
the 1
logic 1
rather 1
than 1
upon 1
the 1
crime 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
dwell 1
You 1
have 1
degraded 1
what 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
lectures 1
into 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
tales 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
cold 1
morning 1
of 1
the 1
early 1
spring 1
and 1
we 1
sat 1
after 1
breakfast 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
cheery 1
fire 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
room 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
A 1
thick 1
fog 1
rolled 1
down 1
between 1
the 1
lines 1
of 1
dun 1
coloured 1
houses 1
and 1
the 1
opposing 1
windows 1
loomed 1
like 1
dark 1
shapeless 1
blurs 1
through 1
the 1
heavy 1
yellow 1
wreaths 1
Our 1
gas 1
was 1
lit 1
and 1
shone 1
on 1
the 1
white 1
cloth 1
and 1
glimmer 1
of 1
china 1
and 1
metal 1
for 1
the 1
table 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
cleared 1
yet 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
had 1
been 1
silent 1
all 1
the 1
morning 1
dipping 1
continuously 1
into 1
the 1
advertisement 1
columns 1
of 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
papers 1
until 1
at 1
last 1
having 1
apparently 1
given 1
up 1
his 1
search 1
he 1
had 1
emerged 1
in 1
no 1
very 1
sweet 1
temper 1
to 1
lecture 1
me 1
upon 1
my 1
literary 1
shortcomings 1
At 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
he 1
remarked 1
after 1
a 1
pause 1
during 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
sat 1
puffing 1
at 1
his 1
long 1
pipe 1
and 1
gazing 1
down 1
into 1
the 1
fire 1
you 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
open 1
to 1
a 1
charge 1
of 1
sensationalism 1
for 1
out 1
of 1
these 1
cases 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
kind 1
as 1
to 1
interest 1
yourself 1
in 1
a 1
fair 1
proportion 1
do 1
not 1
treat 1
of 1
crime 1
in 1
its 1
legal 1
sense 1
at 1
all 1
The 1
small 1
matter 1
in 1
which 1
I 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Bohemia 1
the 1
singular 1
experience 1
of 1
Miss 1
Mary 1
Sutherland 1
the 1
problem 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
the 1
twisted 1
lip 1
and 1
the 1
incident 1
of 1
the 1
noble 1
bachelor 1
were 1
all 1
matters 1
which 1
are 1
outside 1
the 1
pale 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
But 1
in 1
avoiding 1
the 1
sensational 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
bordered 1
on 1
the 1
trivial 1
The 1
end 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
I 1
answered 1
but 1
the 1
methods 1
I 1
hold 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
novel 1
and 1
of 1
interest 1
Pshaw 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow 1
what 1
do 1
the 1
public 1
the 1
great 1
unobservant 1
public 1
who 1
could 1
hardly 1
tell 1
a 1
weaver 1
by 1
his 1
tooth 1
or 1
a 1
compositor 1
by 1
his 1
left 1
thumb 1
care 1
about 1
the 1
finer 1
shades 1
of 1
analysis 1
and 1
deduction 1
But 1
indeed 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
trivial 1
I 1
cannot 1
blame 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
cases 1
are 1
past 1
Man 1
or 1
at 1
least 1
criminal 1
man 1
has 1
lost 1
all 1
enterprise 1
and 1
originality 1
As 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
practice 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
degenerating 1
into 1
an 1
agency 1
for 1
recovering 1
lost 1
lead 1
pencils 1
and 1
giving 1
advice 1
to 1
young 1
ladies 1
from 1
boarding 1
schools 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
touched 1
bottom 1
at 1
last 1
however 1
This 1
note 1
I 1
had 1
this 1
morning 1
marks 1
my 1
zero 1
point 1
I 1
fancy 1
Read 1
it 1
He 1
tossed 1
a 1
crumpled 1
letter 1
across 1
to 1
me 1
It 1
was 1
dated 1
from 1
Montague 1
Place 1
upon 1
the 1
preceding 1
evening 1
and 1
ran 1
thus 1
DEAR 1
MR 1
HOLMES 1
I 1
am 1
very 1
anxious 1
to 1
consult 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
whether 1
I 1
should 1
or 1
should 1
not 1
accept 1
a 1
situation 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
offered 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
governess 1
I 1
shall 1
call 1
at 1
half 1
past 1
ten 1
to 1
morrow 1
if 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
inconvenience 1
you 1
Yours 1
faithfully 1
VIOLET 1
HUNTER 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
I 1
asked 1
Not 1
I 1
It 1
is 1
half 1
past 1
ten 1
now 1
Yes 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
is 1
her 1
ring 1
It 1
may 1
turn 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
more 1
interest 1
than 1
you 1
think 1
You 1
remember 1
that 1
the 1
affair 1
of 1
the 1
blue 1
carbuncle 1
which 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
mere 1
whim 1
at 1
first 1
developed 1
into 1
a 1
serious 1
investigation 1
It 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
in 1
this 1
case 1
also 1
Well 1
let 1
us 1
hope 1
so 1
But 1
our 1
doubts 1
will 1
very 1
soon 1
be 1
solved 1
for 1
here 1
unless 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
is 1
the 1
person 1
in 1
question 1
As 1
he 1
spoke 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
She 1
was 1
plainly 1
but 1
neatly 1
dressed 1
with 1
a 1
bright 1
quick 1
face 1
freckled 1
like 1
a 1
plover 1
s 1
egg 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
brisk 1
manner 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
has 1
had 1
her 1
own 1
way 1
to 1
make 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
You 1
will 1
excuse 1
my 1
troubling 1
you 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
said 1
she 1
as 1
my 1
companion 1
rose 1
to 1
greet 1
her 1
but 1
I 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
very 1
strange 1
experience 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
parents 1
or 1
relations 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
from 1
whom 1
I 1
could 1
ask 1
advice 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
kind 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
Pray 1
take 1
a 1
seat 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
I 1
shall 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
do 1
anything 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
to 1
serve 1
you 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
Holmes 1
was 1
favourably 1
impressed 1
by 1
the 1
manner 1
and 1
speech 1
of 1
his 1
new 1
client 1
He 1
looked 1
her 1
over 1
in 1
his 1
searching 1
fashion 1
and 1
then 1
composed 1
himself 1
with 1
his 1
lids 1
drooping 1
and 1
his 1
finger 1
tips 1
together 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
her 1
story 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
governess 1
for 1
five 1
years 1
said 1
she 1
in 1
the 1
family 1
of 1
Colonel 1
Spence 1
Munro 1
but 1
two 1
months 1
ago 1
the 1
colonel 1
received 1
an 1
appointment 1
at 1
Halifax 1
in 1
Nova 1
Scotia 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
children 1
over 1
to 1
America 1
with 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
without 1
a 1
situation 1
I 1
advertised 1
and 1
I 1
answered 1
advertisements 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
At 1
last 1
the 1
little 1
money 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
saved 1
began 1
to 1
run 1
short 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
my 1
wit 1
s 1
end 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
well 1
known 1
agency 1
for 1
governesses 1
in 1
the 1
West 1
End 1
called 1
Westaway 1
s 1
and 1
there 1
I 1
used 1
to 1
call 1
about 1
once 1
a 1
week 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
see 1
whether 1
anything 1
had 1
turned 1
up 1
which 1
might 1
suit 1
me 1
Westaway 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
founder 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
really 1
managed 1
by 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
She 1
sits 1
in 1
her 1
own 1
little 1
office 1
and 1
the 1
ladies 1
who 1
are 1
seeking 1
employment 1
wait 1
in 1
an 1
anteroom 1
and 1
are 1
then 1
shown 1
in 1
one 1
by 1
one 1
when 1
she 1
consults 1
her 1
ledgers 1
and 1
sees 1
whether 1
she 1
has 1
anything 1
which 1
would 1
suit 1
them 1
Well 1
when 1
I 1
called 1
last 1
week 1
I 1
was 1
shown 1
into 1
the 1
little 1
office 1
as 1
usual 1
but 1
I 1
found 1
that 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
was 1
not 1
alone 1
A 1
prodigiously 1
stout 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
smiling 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
great 1
heavy 1
chin 1
which 1
rolled 1
down 1
in 1
fold 1
upon 1
fold 1
over 1
his 1
throat 1
sat 1
at 1
her 1
elbow 1
with 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
glasses 1
on 1
his 1
nose 1
looking 1
very 1
earnestly 1
at 1
the 1
ladies 1
who 1
entered 1
As 1
I 1
came 1
in 1
he 1
gave 1
quite 1
a 1
jump 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
turned 1
quickly 1
to 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
ask 1
for 1
anything 1
better 1
Capital 1
capital 1
He 1
seemed 1
quite 1
enthusiastic 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
hands 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
genial 1
fashion 1
He 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
comfortable 1
looking 1
man 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
a 1
pleasure 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
him 1
You 1
are 1
looking 1
for 1
a 1
situation 1
miss 1
he 1
asked 1
Yes 1
sir 1
As 1
governess 1
Yes 1
sir 1
And 1
what 1
salary 1
do 1
you 1
ask 1
I 1
had 1
pounds 1
a 1
month 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
place 1
with 1
Colonel 1
Spence 1
Munro 1
Oh 1
tut 1
tut 1
sweating 1
rank 1
sweating 1
he 1
cried 1
throwing 1
his 1
fat 1
hands 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
air 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
boiling 1
passion 1
How 1
could 1
anyone 1
offer 1
so 1
pitiful 1
a 1
sum 1
to 1
a 1
lady 1
with 1
such 1
attractions 1
and 1
accomplishments 1
My 1
accomplishments 1
sir 1
may 1
be 1
less 1
than 1
you 1
imagine 1
said 1
I 1
A 1
little 1
French 1
a 1
little 1
German 1
music 1
and 1
drawing 1
Tut 1
tut 1
he 1
cried 1
This 1
is 1
all 1
quite 1
beside 1
the 1
question 1
The 1
point 1
is 1
have 1
you 1
or 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
the 1
bearing 1
and 1
deportment 1
of 1
a 1
lady 1
There 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
nutshell 1
If 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
fitted 1
for 1
the 1
rearing 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
who 1
may 1
some 1
day 1
play 1
a 1
considerable 1
part 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
But 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
why 1
then 1
how 1
could 1
any 1
gentleman 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
condescend 1
to 1
accept 1
anything 1
under 1
the 1
three 1
figures 1
Your 1
salary 1
with 1
me 1
madam 1
would 1
commence 1
at 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
You 1
may 1
imagine 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
that 1
to 1
me 1
destitute 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
such 1
an 1
offer 1
seemed 1
almost 1
too 1
good 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
The 1
gentleman 1
however 1
seeing 1
perhaps 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
incredulity 1
upon 1
my 1
face 1
opened 1
a 1
pocket 1
book 1
and 1
took 1
out 1
a 1
note 1
It 1
is 1
also 1
my 1
custom 1
said 1
he 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
pleasant 1
fashion 1
until 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
just 1
two 1
little 1
shining 1
slits 1
amid 1
the 1
white 1
creases 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
to 1
advance 1
to 1
my 1
young 1
ladies 1
half 1
their 1
salary 1
beforehand 1
so 1
that 1
they 1
may 1
meet 1
any 1
little 1
expenses 1
of 1
their 1
journey 1
and 1
their 1
wardrobe 1
It 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
never 1
met 1
so 1
fascinating 1
and 1
so 1
thoughtful 1
a 1
man 1
As 1
I 1
was 1
already 1
in 1
debt 1
to 1
my 1
tradesmen 1
the 1
advance 1
was 1
a 1
great 1
convenience 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
unnatural 1
about 1
the 1
whole 1
transaction 1
which 1
made 1
me 1
wish 1
to 1
know 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
before 1
I 1
quite 1
committed 1
myself 1
May 1
I 1
ask 1
where 1
you 1
live 1
sir 1
said 1
I 1
Hampshire 1
Charming 1
rural 1
place 1
The 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
five 1
miles 1
on 1
the 1
far 1
side 1
of 1
Winchester 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
lovely 1
country 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
and 1
the 1
dearest 1
old 1
country 1
house 1
And 1
my 1
duties 1
sir 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
One 1
child 1
one 1
dear 1
little 1
romper 1
just 1
six 1
years 1
old 1
Oh 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
see 1
him 1
killing 1
cockroaches 1
with 1
a 1
slipper 1
Smack 1
smack 1
smack 1
Three 1
gone 1
before 1
you 1
could 1
wink 1
He 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
laughed 1
his 1
eyes 1
into 1
his 1
head 1
again 1
I 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
startled 1
at 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
s 1
amusement 1
but 1
the 1
father 1
s 1
laughter 1
made 1
me 1
think 1
that 1
perhaps 1
he 1
was 1
joking 1
My 1
sole 1
duties 1
then 1
I 1
asked 1
are 1
to 1
take 1
charge 1
of 1
a 1
single 1
child 1
No 1
no 1
not 1
the 1
sole 1
not 1
the 1
sole 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
he 1
cried 1
Your 1
duty 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
your 1
good 1
sense 1
would 1
suggest 1
to 1
obey 1
any 1
little 1
commands 1
my 1
wife 1
might 1
give 1
provided 1
always 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
such 1
commands 1
as 1
a 1
lady 1
might 1
with 1
propriety 1
obey 1
You 1
see 1
no 1
difficulty 1
heh 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
happy 1
to 1
make 1
myself 1
useful 1
Quite 1
so 1
In 1
dress 1
now 1
for 1
example 1
We 1
are 1
faddy 1
people 1
you 1
know 1
faddy 1
but 1
kind 1
hearted 1
If 1
you 1
were 1
asked 1
to 1
wear 1
any 1
dress 1
which 1
we 1
might 1
give 1
you 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
object 1
to 1
our 1
little 1
whim 1
Heh 1
No 1
said 1
I 1
considerably 1
astonished 1
at 1
his 1
words 1
Or 1
to 1
sit 1
here 1
or 1
sit 1
there 1
that 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
offensive 1
to 1
you 1
Oh 1
no 1
Or 1
to 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
quite 1
short 1
before 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
us 1
I 1
could 1
hardly 1
believe 1
my 1
ears 1
As 1
you 1
may 1
observe 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
my 1
hair 1
is 1
somewhat 1
luxuriant 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
rather 1
peculiar 1
tint 1
of 1
chestnut 1
It 1
has 1
been 1
considered 1
artistic 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
dream 1
of 1
sacrificing 1
it 1
in 1
this 1
offhand 1
fashion 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
that 1
is 1
quite 1
impossible 1
said 1
I 1
He 1
had 1
been 1
watching 1
me 1
eagerly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
small 1
eyes 1
and 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
a 1
shadow 1
pass 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
as 1
I 1
spoke 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
essential 1
said 1
he 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
little 1
fancy 1
of 1
my 1
wife 1
s 1
and 1
ladies 1
fancies 1
you 1
know 1
madam 1
ladies 1
fancies 1
must 1
be 1
consulted 1
And 1
so 1
you 1
won 1
t 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
No 1
sir 1
I 1
really 1
could 1
not 1
I 1
answered 1
firmly 1
Ah 1
very 1
well 1
then 1
that 1
quite 1
settles 1
the 1
matter 1
It 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
because 1
in 1
other 1
respects 1
you 1
would 1
really 1
have 1
done 1
very 1
nicely 1
In 1
that 1
case 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
I 1
had 1
best 1
inspect 1
a 1
few 1
more 1
of 1
your 1
young 1
ladies 1
The 1
manageress 1
had 1
sat 1
all 1
this 1
while 1
busy 1
with 1
her 1
papers 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
but 1
she 1
glanced 1
at 1
me 1
now 1
with 1
so 1
much 1
annoyance 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
that 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
suspecting 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
lost 1
a 1
handsome 1
commission 1
through 1
my 1
refusal 1
Do 1
you 1
desire 1
your 1
name 1
to 1
be 1
kept 1
upon 1
the 1
books 1
she 1
asked 1
If 1
you 1
please 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
Well 1
really 1
it 1
seems 1
rather 1
useless 1
since 1
you 1
refuse 1
the 1
most 1
excellent 1
offers 1
in 1
this 1
fashion 1
said 1
she 1
sharply 1
You 1
can 1
hardly 1
expect 1
us 1
to 1
exert 1
ourselves 1
to 1
find 1
another 1
such 1
opening 1
for 1
you 1
Good 1
day 1
to 1
you 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
She 1
struck 1
a 1
gong 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
shown 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
page 1
Well 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
lodgings 1
and 1
found 1
little 1
enough 1
in 1
the 1
cupboard 1
and 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
bills 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
ask 1
myself 1
whether 1
I 1
had 1
not 1
done 1
a 1
very 1
foolish 1
thing 1
After 1
all 1
if 1
these 1
people 1
had 1
strange 1
fads 1
and 1
expected 1
obedience 1
on 1
the 1
most 1
extraordinary 1
matters 1
they 1
were 1
at 1
least 1
ready 1
to 1
pay 1
for 1
their 1
eccentricity 1
Very 1
few 1
governesses 1
in 1
England 1
are 1
getting 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
Besides 1
what 1
use 1
was 1
my 1
hair 1
to 1
me 1
Many 1
people 1
are 1
improved 1
by 1
wearing 1
it 1
short 1
and 1
perhaps 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
among 1
the 1
number 1
Next 1
day 1
I 1
was 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
made 1
a 1
mistake 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
I 1
was 1
sure 1
of 1
it 1
I 1
had 1
almost 1
overcome 1
my 1
pride 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
agency 1
and 1
inquire 1
whether 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
still 1
open 1
when 1
I 1
received 1
this 1
letter 1
from 1
the 1
gentleman 1
himself 1
I 1
have 1
it 1
here 1
and 1
I 1
will 1
read 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
The 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
near 1
Winchester 1
DEAR 1
MISS 1
HUNTER 1
Miss 1
Stoper 1
has 1
very 1
kindly 1
given 1
me 1
your 1
address 1
and 1
I 1
write 1
from 1
here 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
whether 1
you 1
have 1
reconsidered 1
your 1
decision 1
My 1
wife 1
is 1
very 1
anxious 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
come 1
for 1
she 1
has 1
been 1
much 1
attracted 1
by 1
my 1
description 1
of 1
you 1
We 1
are 1
willing 1
to 1
give 1
pounds 1
a 1
quarter 1
or 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
recompense 1
you 1
for 1
any 1
little 1
inconvenience 1
which 1
our 1
fads 1
may 1
cause 1
you 1
They 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
exacting 1
after 1
all 1
My 1
wife 1
is 1
fond 1
of 1
a 1
particular 1
shade 1
of 1
electric 1
blue 1
and 1
would 1
like 1
you 1
to 1
wear 1
such 1
a 1
dress 1
indoors 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
You 1
need 1
not 1
however 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
purchasing 1
one 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
one 1
belonging 1
to 1
my 1
dear 1
daughter 1
Alice 1
now 1
in 1
Philadelphia 1
which 1
would 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
fit 1
you 1
very 1
well 1
Then 1
as 1
to 1
sitting 1
here 1
or 1
there 1
or 1
amusing 1
yourself 1
in 1
any 1
manner 1
indicated 1
that 1
need 1
cause 1
you 1
no 1
inconvenience 1
As 1
regards 1
your 1
hair 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
a 1
pity 1
especially 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
remarking 1
its 1
beauty 1
during 1
our 1
short 1
interview 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
remain 1
firm 1
upon 1
this 1
point 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
hope 1
that 1
the 1
increased 1
salary 1
may 1
recompense 1
you 1
for 1
the 1
loss 1
Your 1
duties 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
child 1
is 1
concerned 1
are 1
very 1
light 1
Now 1
do 1
try 1
to 1
come 1
and 1
I 1
shall 1
meet 1
you 1
with 1
the 1
dog 1
cart 1
at 1
Winchester 1
Let 1
me 1
know 1
your 1
train 1
Yours 1
faithfully 1
JEPHRO 1
RUCASTLE 1
That 1
is 1
the 1
letter 1
which 1
I 1
have 1
just 1
received 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
my 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
that 1
I 1
will 1
accept 1
it 1
I 1
thought 1
however 1
that 1
before 1
taking 1
the 1
final 1
step 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
submit 1
the 1
whole 1
matter 1
to 1
your 1
consideration 1
Well 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
if 1
your 1
mind 1
is 1
made 1
up 1
that 1
settles 1
the 1
question 1
said 1
Holmes 1
smiling 1
But 1
you 1
would 1
not 1
advise 1
me 1
to 1
refuse 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
situation 1
which 1
I 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
sister 1
of 1
mine 1
apply 1
for 1
What 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
Ah 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
data 1
I 1
cannot 1
tell 1
Perhaps 1
you 1
have 1
yourself 1
formed 1
some 1
opinion 1
Well 1
there 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
only 1
one 1
possible 1
solution 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
kind 1
good 1
natured 1
man 1
Is 1
it 1
not 1
possible 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
is 1
a 1
lunatic 1
that 1
he 1
desires 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
matter 1
quiet 1
for 1
fear 1
she 1
should 1
be 1
taken 1
to 1
an 1
asylum 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
humours 1
her 1
fancies 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
prevent 1
an 1
outbreak 1
That 1
is 1
a 1
possible 1
solution 1
in 1
fact 1
as 1
matters 1
stand 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
probable 1
one 1
But 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
nice 1
household 1
for 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
But 1
the 1
money 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
the 1
money 1
Well 1
yes 1
of 1
course 1
the 1
pay 1
is 1
good 1
too 1
good 1
That 1
is 1
what 1
makes 1
me 1
uneasy 1
Why 1
should 1
they 1
give 1
you 1
pounds 1
a 1
year 1
when 1
they 1
could 1
have 1
their 1
pick 1
for 1
pounds 1
There 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
strong 1
reason 1
behind 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
if 1
I 1
told 1
you 1
the 1
circumstances 1
you 1
would 1
understand 1
afterwards 1
if 1
I 1
wanted 1
your 1
help 1
I 1
should 1
feel 1
so 1
much 1
stronger 1
if 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
me 1
Oh 1
you 1
may 1
carry 1
that 1
feeling 1
away 1
with 1
you 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
little 1
problem 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
interesting 1
which 1
has 1
come 1
my 1
way 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
There 1
is 1
something 1
distinctly 1
novel 1
about 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
features 1
If 1
you 1
should 1
find 1
yourself 1
in 1
doubt 1
or 1
in 1
danger 1
Danger 1
What 1
danger 1
do 1
you 1
foresee 1
Holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
gravely 1
It 1
would 1
cease 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
danger 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
define 1
it 1
said 1
he 1
But 1
at 1
any 1
time 1
day 1
or 1
night 1
a 1
telegram 1
would 1
bring 1
me 1
down 1
to 1
your 1
help 1
That 1
is 1
enough 1
She 1
rose 1
briskly 1
from 1
her 1
chair 1
with 1
the 1
anxiety 1
all 1
swept 1
from 1
her 1
face 1
I 1
shall 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
Hampshire 1
quite 1
easy 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
now 1
I 1
shall 1
write 1
to 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
at 1
once 1
sacrifice 1
my 1
poor 1
hair 1
to 1
night 1
and 1
start 1
for 1
Winchester 1
to 1
morrow 1
With 1
a 1
few 1
grateful 1
words 1
to 1
Holmes 1
she 1
bade 1
us 1
both 1
good 1
night 1
and 1
bustled 1
off 1
upon 1
her 1
way 1
At 1
least 1
said 1
I 1
as 1
we 1
heard 1
her 1
quick 1
firm 1
steps 1
descending 1
the 1
stairs 1
she 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
who 1
is 1
very 1
well 1
able 1
to 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
herself 1
And 1
she 1
would 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
said 1
Holmes 1
gravely 1
I 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
if 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
hear 1
from 1
her 1
before 1
many 1
days 1
are 1
past 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
very 1
long 1
before 1
my 1
friend 1
s 1
prediction 1
was 1
fulfilled 1
A 1
fortnight 1
went 1
by 1
during 1
which 1
I 1
frequently 1
found 1
my 1
thoughts 1
turning 1
in 1
her 1
direction 1
and 1
wondering 1
what 1
strange 1
side 1
alley 1
of 1
human 1
experience 1
this 1
lonely 1
woman 1
had 1
strayed 1
into 1
The 1
unusual 1
salary 1
the 1
curious 1
conditions 1
the 1
light 1
duties 1
all 1
pointed 1
to 1
something 1
abnormal 1
though 1
whether 1
a 1
fad 1
or 1
a 1
plot 1
or 1
whether 1
the 1
man 1
were 1
a 1
philanthropist 1
or 1
a 1
villain 1
it 1
was 1
quite 1
beyond 1
my 1
powers 1
to 1
determine 1
As 1
to 1
Holmes 1
I 1
observed 1
that 1
he 1
sat 1
frequently 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
on 1
end 1
with 1
knitted 1
brows 1
and 1
an 1
abstracted 1
air 1
but 1
he 1
swept 1
the 1
matter 1
away 1
with 1
a 1
wave 1
of 1
his 1
hand 1
when 1
I 1
mentioned 1
it 1
Data 1
data 1
data 1
he 1
cried 1
impatiently 1
I 1
can 1
t 1
make 1
bricks 1
without 1
clay 1
And 1
yet 1
he 1
would 1
always 1
wind 1
up 1
by 1
muttering 1
that 1
no 1
sister 1
of 1
his 1
should 1
ever 1
have 1
accepted 1
such 1
a 1
situation 1
The 1
telegram 1
which 1
we 1
eventually 1
received 1
came 1
late 1
one 1
night 1
just 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
thinking 1
of 1
turning 1
in 1
and 1
Holmes 1
was 1
settling 1
down 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
all 1
night 1
chemical 1
researches 1
which 1
he 1
frequently 1
indulged 1
in 1
when 1
I 1
would 1
leave 1
him 1
stooping 1
over 1
a 1
retort 1
and 1
a 1
test 1
tube 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
find 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
position 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
breakfast 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
He 1
opened 1
the 1
yellow 1
envelope 1
and 1
then 1
glancing 1
at 1
the 1
message 1
threw 1
it 1
across 1
to 1
me 1
Just 1
look 1
up 1
the 1
trains 1
in 1
Bradshaw 1
said 1
he 1
and 1
turned 1
back 1
to 1
his 1
chemical 1
studies 1
The 1
summons 1
was 1
a 1
brief 1
and 1
urgent 1
one 1
Please 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
Black 1
Swan 1
Hotel 1
at 1
Winchester 1
at 1
midday 1
to 1
morrow 1
it 1
said 1
Do 1
come 1
I 1
am 1
at 1
my 1
wit 1
s 1
end 1
HUNTER 1
Will 1
you 1
come 1
with 1
me 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
glancing 1
up 1
I 1
should 1
wish 1
to 1
Just 1
look 1
it 1
up 1
then 1
There 1
is 1
a 1
train 1
at 1
half 1
past 1
nine 1
said 1
I 1
glancing 1
over 1
my 1
Bradshaw 1
It 1
is 1
due 1
at 1
Winchester 1
at 1
That 1
will 1
do 1
very 1
nicely 1
Then 1
perhaps 1
I 1
had 1
better 1
postpone 1
my 1
analysis 1
of 1
the 1
acetones 1
as 1
we 1
may 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
our 1
best 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
By 1
eleven 1
o 1
clock 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
we 1
were 1
well 1
upon 1
our 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
English 1
capital 1
Holmes 1
had 1
been 1
buried 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
papers 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
but 1
after 1
we 1
had 1
passed 1
the 1
Hampshire 1
border 1
he 1
threw 1
them 1
down 1
and 1
began 1
to 1
admire 1
the 1
scenery 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
ideal 1
spring 1
day 1
a 1
light 1
blue 1
sky 1
flecked 1
with 1
little 1
fleecy 1
white 1
clouds 1
drifting 1
across 1
from 1
west 1
to 1
east 1
The 1
sun 1
was 1
shining 1
very 1
brightly 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
exhilarating 1
nip 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
which 1
set 1
an 1
edge 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
s 1
energy 1
All 1
over 1
the 1
countryside 1
away 1
to 1
the 1
rolling 1
hills 1
around 1
Aldershot 1
the 1
little 1
red 1
and 1
grey 1
roofs 1
of 1
the 1
farm 1
steadings 1
peeped 1
out 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
light 1
green 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
foliage 1
Are 1
they 1
not 1
fresh 1
and 1
beautiful 1
I 1
cried 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
enthusiasm 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
fresh 1
from 1
the 1
fogs 1
of 1
Baker 1
Street 1
But 1
Holmes 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
gravely 1
Do 1
you 1
know 1
Watson 1
said 1
he 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
curses 1
of 1
a 1
mind 1
with 1
a 1
turn 1
like 1
mine 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
look 1
at 1
everything 1
with 1
reference 1
to 1
my 1
own 1
special 1
subject 1
You 1
look 1
at 1
these 1
scattered 1
houses 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
impressed 1
by 1
their 1
beauty 1
I 1
look 1
at 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
thought 1
which 1
comes 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
their 1
isolation 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
impunity 1
with 1
which 1
crime 1
may 1
be 1
committed 1
there 1
Good 1
heavens 1
I 1
cried 1
Who 1
would 1
associate 1
crime 1
with 1
these 1
dear 1
old 1
homesteads 1
They 1
always 1
fill 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
certain 1
horror 1
It 1
is 1
my 1
belief 1
Watson 1
founded 1
upon 1
my 1
experience 1
that 1
the 1
lowest 1
and 1
vilest 1
alleys 1
in 1
London 1
do 1
not 1
present 1
a 1
more 1
dreadful 1
record 1
of 1
sin 1
than 1
does 1
the 1
smiling 1
and 1
beautiful 1
countryside 1
You 1
horrify 1
me 1
But 1
the 1
reason 1
is 1
very 1
obvious 1
The 1
pressure 1
of 1
public 1
opinion 1
can 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
what 1
the 1
law 1
cannot 1
accomplish 1
There 1
is 1
no 1
lane 1
so 1
vile 1
that 1
the 1
scream 1
of 1
a 1
tortured 1
child 1
or 1
the 1
thud 1
of 1
a 1
drunkard 1
s 1
blow 1
does 1
not 1
beget 1
sympathy 1
and 1
indignation 1
among 1
the 1
neighbours 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
whole 1
machinery 1
of 1
justice 1
is 1
ever 1
so 1
close 1
that 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
complaint 1
can 1
set 1
it 1
going 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
a 1
step 1
between 1
the 1
crime 1
and 1
the 1
dock 1
But 1
look 1
at 1
these 1
lonely 1
houses 1
each 1
in 1
its 1
own 1
fields 1
filled 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
with 1
poor 1
ignorant 1
folk 1
who 1
know 1
little 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
Think 1
of 1
the 1
deeds 1
of 1
hellish 1
cruelty 1
the 1
hidden 1
wickedness 1
which 1
may 1
go 1
on 1
year 1
in 1
year 1
out 1
in 1
such 1
places 1
and 1
none 1
the 1
wiser 1
Had 1
this 1
lady 1
who 1
appeals 1
to 1
us 1
for 1
help 1
gone 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
Winchester 1
I 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
fear 1
for 1
her 1
It 1
is 1
the 1
five 1
miles 1
of 1
country 1
which 1
makes 1
the 1
danger 1
Still 1
it 1
is 1
clear 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
not 1
personally 1
threatened 1
No 1
If 1
she 1
can 1
come 1
to 1
Winchester 1
to 1
meet 1
us 1
she 1
can 1
get 1
away 1
Quite 1
so 1
She 1
has 1
her 1
freedom 1
What 1
CAN 1
be 1
the 1
matter 1
then 1
Can 1
you 1
suggest 1
no 1
explanation 1
I 1
have 1
devised 1
seven 1
separate 1
explanations 1
each 1
of 1
which 1
would 1
cover 1
the 1
facts 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
we 1
know 1
them 1
But 1
which 1
of 1
these 1
is 1
correct 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
determined 1
by 1
the 1
fresh 1
information 1
which 1
we 1
shall 1
no 1
doubt 1
find 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
Well 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
tower 1
of 1
the 1
cathedral 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
learn 1
all 1
that 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
has 1
to 1
tell 1
The 1
Black 1
Swan 1
is 1
an 1
inn 1
of 1
repute 1
in 1
the 1
High 1
Street 1
at 1
no 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
station 1
and 1
there 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
She 1
had 1
engaged 1
a 1
sitting 1
room 1
and 1
our 1
lunch 1
awaited 1
us 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
delighted 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
come 1
she 1
said 1
earnestly 1
It 1
is 1
so 1
very 1
kind 1
of 1
you 1
both 1
but 1
indeed 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
Your 1
advice 1
will 1
be 1
altogether 1
invaluable 1
to 1
me 1
Pray 1
tell 1
us 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
to 1
you 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
so 1
and 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
quick 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
promised 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
to 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
three 1
I 1
got 1
his 1
leave 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
town 1
this 1
morning 1
though 1
he 1
little 1
knew 1
for 1
what 1
purpose 1
Let 1
us 1
have 1
everything 1
in 1
its 1
due 1
order 1
Holmes 1
thrust 1
his 1
long 1
thin 1
legs 1
out 1
towards 1
the 1
fire 1
and 1
composed 1
himself 1
to 1
listen 1
In 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
I 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
met 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
with 1
no 1
actual 1
ill 1
treatment 1
from 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
It 1
is 1
only 1
fair 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
But 1
I 1
cannot 1
understand 1
them 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
easy 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
about 1
them 1
What 1
can 1
you 1
not 1
understand 1
Their 1
reasons 1
for 1
their 1
conduct 1
But 1
you 1
shall 1
have 1
it 1
all 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
occurred 1
When 1
I 1
came 1
down 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
met 1
me 1
here 1
and 1
drove 1
me 1
in 1
his 1
dog 1
cart 1
to 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
It 1
is 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
beautifully 1
situated 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
beautiful 1
in 1
itself 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
large 1
square 1
block 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
whitewashed 1
but 1
all 1
stained 1
and 1
streaked 1
with 1
damp 1
and 1
bad 1
weather 1
There 1
are 1
grounds 1
round 1
it 1
woods 1
on 1
three 1
sides 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
fourth 1
a 1
field 1
which 1
slopes 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
Southampton 1
highroad 1
which 1
curves 1
past 1
about 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
This 1
ground 1
in 1
front 1
belongs 1
to 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
the 1
woods 1
all 1
round 1
are 1
part 1
of 1
Lord 1
Southerton 1
s 1
preserves 1
A 1
clump 1
of 1
copper 1
beeches 1
immediately 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
has 1
given 1
its 1
name 1
to 1
the 1
place 1
I 1
was 1
driven 1
over 1
by 1
my 1
employer 1
who 1
was 1
as 1
amiable 1
as 1
ever 1
and 1
was 1
introduced 1
by 1
him 1
that 1
evening 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
truth 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
in 1
the 1
conjecture 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
probable 1
in 1
your 1
rooms 1
at 1
Baker 1
Street 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
is 1
not 1
mad 1
I 1
found 1
her 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
silent 1
pale 1
faced 1
woman 1
much 1
younger 1
than 1
her 1
husband 1
not 1
more 1
than 1
thirty 1
I 1
should 1
think 1
while 1
he 1
can 1
hardly 1
be 1
less 1
than 1
forty 1
five 1
From 1
their 1
conversation 1
I 1
have 1
gathered 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
been 1
married 1
about 1
seven 1
years 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
widower 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
only 1
child 1
by 1
the 1
first 1
wife 1
was 1
the 1
daughter 1
who 1
has 1
gone 1
to 1
Philadelphia 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
told 1
me 1
in 1
private 1
that 1
the 1
reason 1
why 1
she 1
had 1
left 1
them 1
was 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
an 1
unreasoning 1
aversion 1
to 1
her 1
stepmother 1
As 1
the 1
daughter 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
less 1
than 1
twenty 1
I 1
can 1
quite 1
imagine 1
that 1
her 1
position 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
uncomfortable 1
with 1
her 1
father 1
s 1
young 1
wife 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
colourless 1
in 1
mind 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
in 1
feature 1
She 1
impressed 1
me 1
neither 1
favourably 1
nor 1
the 1
reverse 1
She 1
was 1
a 1
nonentity 1
It 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
passionately 1
devoted 1
both 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
and 1
to 1
her 1
little 1
son 1
Her 1
light 1
grey 1
eyes 1
wandered 1
continually 1
from 1
one 1
to 1
the 1
other 1
noting 1
every 1
little 1
want 1
and 1
forestalling 1
it 1
if 1
possible 1
He 1
was 1
kind 1
to 1
her 1
also 1
in 1
his 1
bluff 1
boisterous 1
fashion 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
they 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
happy 1
couple 1
And 1
yet 1
she 1
had 1
some 1
secret 1
sorrow 1
this 1
woman 1
She 1
would 1
often 1
be 1
lost 1
in 1
deep 1
thought 1
with 1
the 1
saddest 1
look 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
More 1
than 1
once 1
I 1
have 1
surprised 1
her 1
in 1
tears 1
I 1
have 1
thought 1
sometimes 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
disposition 1
of 1
her 1
child 1
which 1
weighed 1
upon 1
her 1
mind 1
for 1
I 1
have 1
never 1
met 1
so 1
utterly 1
spoiled 1
and 1
so 1
ill 1
natured 1
a 1
little 1
creature 1
He 1
is 1
small 1
for 1
his 1
age 1
with 1
a 1
head 1
which 1
is 1
quite 1
disproportionately 1
large 1
His 1
whole 1
life 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
spent 1
in 1
an 1
alternation 1
between 1
savage 1
fits 1
of 1
passion 1
and 1
gloomy 1
intervals 1
of 1
sulking 1
Giving 1
pain 1
to 1
any 1
creature 1
weaker 1
than 1
himself 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
his 1
one 1
idea 1
of 1
amusement 1
and 1
he 1
shows 1
quite 1
remarkable 1
talent 1
in 1
planning 1
the 1
capture 1
of 1
mice 1
little 1
birds 1
and 1
insects 1
But 1
I 1
would 1
rather 1
not 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
creature 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
indeed 1
he 1
has 1
little 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
my 1
story 1
I 1
am 1
glad 1
of 1
all 1
details 1
remarked 1
my 1
friend 1
whether 1
they 1
seem 1
to 1
you 1
to 1
be 1
relevant 1
or 1
not 1
I 1
shall 1
try 1
not 1
to 1
miss 1
anything 1
of 1
importance 1
The 1
one 1
unpleasant 1
thing 1
about 1
the 1
house 1
which 1
struck 1
me 1
at 1
once 1
was 1
the 1
appearance 1
and 1
conduct 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
There 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
Toller 1
for 1
that 1
is 1
his 1
name 1
is 1
a 1
rough 1
uncouth 1
man 1
with 1
grizzled 1
hair 1
and 1
whiskers 1
and 1
a 1
perpetual 1
smell 1
of 1
drink 1
Twice 1
since 1
I 1
have 1
been 1
with 1
them 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
quite 1
drunk 1
and 1
yet 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
seemed 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
it 1
His 1
wife 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
tall 1
and 1
strong 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
sour 1
face 1
as 1
silent 1
as 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
and 1
much 1
less 1
amiable 1
They 1
are 1
a 1
most 1
unpleasant 1
couple 1
but 1
fortunately 1
I 1
spend 1
most 1
of 1
my 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
nursery 1
and 1
my 1
own 1
room 1
which 1
are 1
next 1
to 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
one 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
building 1
For 1
two 1
days 1
after 1
my 1
arrival 1
at 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
my 1
life 1
was 1
very 1
quiet 1
on 1
the 1
third 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
came 1
down 1
just 1
after 1
breakfast 1
and 1
whispered 1
something 1
to 1
her 1
husband 1
Oh 1
yes 1
said 1
he 1
turning 1
to 1
me 1
we 1
are 1
very 1
much 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
for 1
falling 1
in 1
with 1
our 1
whims 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
to 1
cut 1
your 1
hair 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
detracted 1
in 1
the 1
tiniest 1
iota 1
from 1
your 1
appearance 1
We 1
shall 1
now 1
see 1
how 1
the 1
electric 1
blue 1
dress 1
will 1
become 1
you 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
laid 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
bed 1
in 1
your 1
room 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
would 1
be 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
to 1
put 1
it 1
on 1
we 1
should 1
both 1
be 1
extremely 1
obliged 1
The 1
dress 1
which 1
I 1
found 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
peculiar 1
shade 1
of 1
blue 1
It 1
was 1
of 1
excellent 1
material 1
a 1
sort 1
of 1
beige 1
but 1
it 1
bore 1
unmistakable 1
signs 1
of 1
having 1
been 1
worn 1
before 1
It 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
better 1
fit 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
measured 1
for 1
it 1
Both 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
expressed 1
a 1
delight 1
at 1
the 1
look 1
of 1
it 1
which 1
seemed 1
quite 1
exaggerated 1
in 1
its 1
vehemence 1
They 1
were 1
waiting 1
for 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
large 1
room 1
stretching 1
along 1
the 1
entire 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
three 1
long 1
windows 1
reaching 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
floor 1
A 1
chair 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
central 1
window 1
with 1
its 1
back 1
turned 1
towards 1
it 1
In 1
this 1
I 1
was 1
asked 1
to 1
sit 1
and 1
then 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
walking 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
began 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
a 1
series 1
of 1
the 1
funniest 1
stories 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
listened 1
to 1
You 1
cannot 1
imagine 1
how 1
comical 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
I 1
laughed 1
until 1
I 1
was 1
quite 1
weary 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
however 1
who 1
has 1
evidently 1
no 1
sense 1
of 1
humour 1
never 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
smiled 1
but 1
sat 1
with 1
her 1
hands 1
in 1
her 1
lap 1
and 1
a 1
sad 1
anxious 1
look 1
upon 1
her 1
face 1
After 1
an 1
hour 1
or 1
so 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
suddenly 1
remarked 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
time 1
to 1
commence 1
the 1
duties 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
might 1
change 1
my 1
dress 1
and 1
go 1
to 1
little 1
Edward 1
in 1
the 1
nursery 1
Two 1
days 1
later 1
this 1
same 1
performance 1
was 1
gone 1
through 1
under 1
exactly 1
similar 1
circumstances 1
Again 1
I 1
changed 1
my 1
dress 1
again 1
I 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
again 1
I 1
laughed 1
very 1
heartily 1
at 1
the 1
funny 1
stories 1
of 1
which 1
my 1
employer 1
had 1
an 1
immense 1
repertoire 1
and 1
which 1
he 1
told 1
inimitably 1
Then 1
he 1
handed 1
me 1
a 1
yellow 1
backed 1
novel 1
and 1
moving 1
my 1
chair 1
a 1
little 1
sideways 1
that 1
my 1
own 1
shadow 1
might 1
not 1
fall 1
upon 1
the 1
page 1
he 1
begged 1
me 1
to 1
read 1
aloud 1
to 1
him 1
I 1
read 1
for 1
about 1
ten 1
minutes 1
beginning 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
a 1
chapter 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
a 1
sentence 1
he 1
ordered 1
me 1
to 1
cease 1
and 1
to 1
change 1
my 1
dress 1
You 1
can 1
easily 1
imagine 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
how 1
curious 1
I 1
became 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
performance 1
could 1
possibly 1
be 1
They 1
were 1
always 1
very 1
careful 1
I 1
observed 1
to 1
turn 1
my 1
face 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
became 1
consumed 1
with 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
behind 1
my 1
back 1
At 1
first 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
impossible 1
but 1
I 1
soon 1
devised 1
a 1
means 1
My 1
hand 1
mirror 1
had 1
been 1
broken 1
so 1
a 1
happy 1
thought 1
seized 1
me 1
and 1
I 1
concealed 1
a 1
piece 1
of 1
the 1
glass 1
in 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
On 1
the 1
next 1
occasion 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
my 1
laughter 1
I 1
put 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
and 1
was 1
able 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
management 1
to 1
see 1
all 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
I 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
disappointed 1
There 1
was 1
nothing 1
At 1
least 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
first 1
impression 1
At 1
the 1
second 1
glance 1
however 1
I 1
perceived 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
Southampton 1
Road 1
a 1
small 1
bearded 1
man 1
in 1
a 1
grey 1
suit 1
who 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
looking 1
in 1
my 1
direction 1
The 1
road 1
is 1
an 1
important 1
highway 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
usually 1
people 1
there 1
This 1
man 1
however 1
was 1
leaning 1
against 1
the 1
railings 1
which 1
bordered 1
our 1
field 1
and 1
was 1
looking 1
earnestly 1
up 1
I 1
lowered 1
my 1
handkerchief 1
and 1
glanced 1
at 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
upon 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
most 1
searching 1
gaze 1
She 1
said 1
nothing 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
convinced 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
divined 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
a 1
mirror 1
in 1
my 1
hand 1
and 1
had 1
seen 1
what 1
was 1
behind 1
me 1
She 1
rose 1
at 1
once 1
Jephro 1
said 1
she 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
impertinent 1
fellow 1
upon 1
the 1
road 1
there 1
who 1
stares 1
up 1
at 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
No 1
friend 1
of 1
yours 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
he 1
asked 1
No 1
I 1
know 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
these 1
parts 1
Dear 1
me 1
How 1
very 1
impertinent 1
Kindly 1
turn 1
round 1
and 1
motion 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
away 1
Surely 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
better 1
to 1
take 1
no 1
notice 1
No 1
no 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
him 1
loitering 1
here 1
always 1
Kindly 1
turn 1
round 1
and 1
wave 1
him 1
away 1
like 1
that 1
I 1
did 1
as 1
I 1
was 1
told 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
drew 1
down 1
the 1
blind 1
That 1
was 1
a 1
week 1
ago 1
and 1
from 1
that 1
time 1
I 1
have 1
not 1
sat 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
window 1
nor 1
have 1
I 1
worn 1
the 1
blue 1
dress 1
nor 1
seen 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
Pray 1
continue 1
said 1
Holmes 1
Your 1
narrative 1
promises 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
most 1
interesting 1
one 1
You 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
rather 1
disconnected 1
I 1
fear 1
and 1
there 1
may 1
prove 1
to 1
be 1
little 1
relation 1
between 1
the 1
different 1
incidents 1
of 1
which 1
I 1
speak 1
On 1
the 1
very 1
first 1
day 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
took 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
outhouse 1
which 1
stands 1
near 1
the 1
kitchen 1
door 1
As 1
we 1
approached 1
it 1
I 1
heard 1
the 1
sharp 1
rattling 1
of 1
a 1
chain 1
and 1
the 1
sound 1
as 1
of 1
a 1
large 1
animal 1
moving 1
about 1
Look 1
in 1
here 1
said 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
showing 1
me 1
a 1
slit 1
between 1
two 1
planks 1
Is 1
he 1
not 1
a 1
beauty 1
I 1
looked 1
through 1
and 1
was 1
conscious 1
of 1
two 1
glowing 1
eyes 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
vague 1
figure 1
huddled 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
Don 1
t 1
be 1
frightened 1
said 1
my 1
employer 1
laughing 1
at 1
the 1
start 1
which 1
I 1
had 1
given 1
It 1
s 1
only 1
Carlo 1
my 1
mastiff 1
I 1
call 1
him 1
mine 1
but 1
really 1
old 1
Toller 1
my 1
groom 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
man 1
who 1
can 1
do 1
anything 1
with 1
him 1
We 1
feed 1
him 1
once 1
a 1
day 1
and 1
not 1
too 1
much 1
then 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
always 1
as 1
keen 1
as 1
mustard 1
Toller 1
lets 1
him 1
loose 1
every 1
night 1
and 1
God 1
help 1
the 1
trespasser 1
whom 1
he 1
lays 1
his 1
fangs 1
upon 1
For 1
goodness 1
sake 1
don 1
t 1
you 1
ever 1
on 1
any 1
pretext 1
set 1
your 1
foot 1
over 1
the 1
threshold 1
at 1
night 1
for 1
it 1
s 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
your 1
life 1
is 1
worth 1
The 1
warning 1
was 1
no 1
idle 1
one 1
for 1
two 1
nights 1
later 1
I 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
bedroom 1
window 1
about 1
two 1
o 1
clock 1
in 1
the 1
morning 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
beautiful 1
moonlight 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
lawn 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
was 1
silvered 1
over 1
and 1
almost 1
as 1
bright 1
as 1
day 1
I 1
was 1
standing 1
rapt 1
in 1
the 1
peaceful 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
scene 1
when 1
I 1
was 1
aware 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
moving 1
under 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
As 1
it 1
emerged 1
into 1
the 1
moonshine 1
I 1
saw 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
It 1
was 1
a 1
giant 1
dog 1
as 1
large 1
as 1
a 1
calf 1
tawny 1
tinted 1
with 1
hanging 1
jowl 1
black 1
muzzle 1
and 1
huge 1
projecting 1
bones 1
It 1
walked 1
slowly 1
across 1
the 1
lawn 1
and 1
vanished 1
into 1
the 1
shadow 1
upon 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
That 1
dreadful 1
sentinel 1
sent 1
a 1
chill 1
to 1
my 1
heart 1
which 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
any 1
burglar 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
And 1
now 1
I 1
have 1
a 1
very 1
strange 1
experience 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
had 1
as 1
you 1
know 1
cut 1
off 1
my 1
hair 1
in 1
London 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
placed 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
coil 1
at 1
the 1
bottom 1
of 1
my 1
trunk 1
One 1
evening 1
after 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
in 1
bed 1
I 1
began 1
to 1
amuse 1
myself 1
by 1
examining 1
the 1
furniture 1
of 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
by 1
rearranging 1
my 1
own 1
little 1
things 1
There 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
chest 1
of 1
drawers 1
in 1
the 1
room 1
the 1
two 1
upper 1
ones 1
empty 1
and 1
open 1
the 1
lower 1
one 1
locked 1
I 1
had 1
filled 1
the 1
first 1
two 1
with 1
my 1
linen 1
and 1
as 1
I 1
had 1
still 1
much 1
to 1
pack 1
away 1
I 1
was 1
naturally 1
annoyed 1
at 1
not 1
having 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
third 1
drawer 1
It 1
struck 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
fastened 1
by 1
a 1
mere 1
oversight 1
so 1
I 1
took 1
out 1
my 1
bunch 1
of 1
keys 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
open 1
it 1
The 1
very 1
first 1
key 1
fitted 1
to 1
perfection 1
and 1
I 1
drew 1
the 1
drawer 1
open 1
There 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
in 1
it 1
but 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
never 1
guess 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
It 1
was 1
my 1
coil 1
of 1
hair 1
I 1
took 1
it 1
up 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
It 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
peculiar 1
tint 1
and 1
the 1
same 1
thickness 1
But 1
then 1
the 1
impossibility 1
of 1
the 1
thing 1
obtruded 1
itself 1
upon 1
me 1
How 1
could 1
my 1
hair 1
have 1
been 1
locked 1
in 1
the 1
drawer 1
With 1
trembling 1
hands 1
I 1
undid 1
my 1
trunk 1
turned 1
out 1
the 1
contents 1
and 1
drew 1
from 1
the 1
bottom 1
my 1
own 1
hair 1
I 1
laid 1
the 1
two 1
tresses 1
together 1
and 1
I 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
identical 1
Was 1
it 1
not 1
extraordinary 1
Puzzle 1
as 1
I 1
would 1
I 1
could 1
make 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
of 1
what 1
it 1
meant 1
I 1
returned 1
the 1
strange 1
hair 1
to 1
the 1
drawer 1
and 1
I 1
said 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
matter 1
to 1
the 1
Rucastles 1
as 1
I 1
felt 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
put 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
by 1
opening 1
a 1
drawer 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
locked 1
I 1
am 1
naturally 1
observant 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
remarked 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
soon 1
had 1
a 1
pretty 1
good 1
plan 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
house 1
in 1
my 1
head 1
There 1
was 1
one 1
wing 1
however 1
which 1
appeared 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
inhabited 1
at 1
all 1
A 1
door 1
which 1
faced 1
that 1
which 1
led 1
into 1
the 1
quarters 1
of 1
the 1
Tollers 1
opened 1
into 1
this 1
suite 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
invariably 1
locked 1
One 1
day 1
however 1
as 1
I 1
ascended 1
the 1
stair 1
I 1
met 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
coming 1
out 1
through 1
this 1
door 1
his 1
keys 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
and 1
a 1
look 1
on 1
his 1
face 1
which 1
made 1
him 1
a 1
very 1
different 1
person 1
to 1
the 1
round 1
jovial 1
man 1
to 1
whom 1
I 1
was 1
accustomed 1
His 1
cheeks 1
were 1
red 1
his 1
brow 1
was 1
all 1
crinkled 1
with 1
anger 1
and 1
the 1
veins 1
stood 1
out 1
at 1
his 1
temples 1
with 1
passion 1
He 1
locked 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
hurried 1
past 1
me 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
or 1
a 1
look 1
This 1
aroused 1
my 1
curiosity 1
so 1
when 1
I 1
went 1
out 1
for 1
a 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
grounds 1
with 1
my 1
charge 1
I 1
strolled 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
side 1
from 1
which 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
the 1
windows 1
of 1
this 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
There 1
were 1
four 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
a 1
row 1
three 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
simply 1
dirty 1
while 1
the 1
fourth 1
was 1
shuttered 1
up 1
They 1
were 1
evidently 1
all 1
deserted 1
As 1
I 1
strolled 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
glancing 1
at 1
them 1
occasionally 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
came 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
looking 1
as 1
merry 1
and 1
jovial 1
as 1
ever 1
Ah 1
said 1
he 1
you 1
must 1
not 1
think 1
me 1
rude 1
if 1
I 1
passed 1
you 1
without 1
a 1
word 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
I 1
was 1
preoccupied 1
with 1
business 1
matters 1
I 1
assured 1
him 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
offended 1
By 1
the 1
way 1
said 1
I 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
quite 1
a 1
suite 1
of 1
spare 1
rooms 1
up 1
there 1
and 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
has 1
the 1
shutters 1
up 1
He 1
looked 1
surprised 1
and 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
little 1
startled 1
at 1
my 1
remark 1
Photography 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
hobbies 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
have 1
made 1
my 1
dark 1
room 1
up 1
there 1
But 1
dear 1
me 1
what 1
an 1
observant 1
young 1
lady 1
we 1
have 1
come 1
upon 1
Who 1
would 1
have 1
believed 1
it 1
Who 1
would 1
have 1
ever 1
believed 1
it 1
He 1
spoke 1
in 1
a 1
jesting 1
tone 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
jest 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
I 1
read 1
suspicion 1
there 1
and 1
annoyance 1
but 1
no 1
jest 1
Well 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
that 1
I 1
understood 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
about 1
that 1
suite 1
of 1
rooms 1
which 1
I 1
was 1
not 1
to 1
know 1
I 1
was 1
all 1
on 1
fire 1
to 1
go 1
over 1
them 1
It 1
was 1
not 1
mere 1
curiosity 1
though 1
I 1
have 1
my 1
share 1
of 1
that 1
It 1
was 1
more 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
duty 1
a 1
feeling 1
that 1
some 1
good 1
might 1
come 1
from 1
my 1
penetrating 1
to 1
this 1
place 1
They 1
talk 1
of 1
woman 1
s 1
instinct 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was 1
woman 1
s 1
instinct 1
which 1
gave 1
me 1
that 1
feeling 1
At 1
any 1
rate 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
and 1
I 1
was 1
keenly 1
on 1
the 1
lookout 1
for 1
any 1
chance 1
to 1
pass 1
the 1
forbidden 1
door 1
It 1
was 1
only 1
yesterday 1
that 1
the 1
chance 1
came 1
I 1
may 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
besides 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
both 1
Toller 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
find 1
something 1
to 1
do 1
in 1
these 1
deserted 1
rooms 1
and 1
I 1
once 1
saw 1
him 1
carrying 1
a 1
large 1
black 1
linen 1
bag 1
with 1
him 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
Recently 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
drinking 1
hard 1
and 1
yesterday 1
evening 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
drunk 1
and 1
when 1
I 1
came 1
upstairs 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
key 1
in 1
the 1
door 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
at 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
there 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
were 1
both 1
downstairs 1
and 1
the 1
child 1
was 1
with 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
had 1
an 1
admirable 1
opportunity 1
I 1
turned 1
the 1
key 1
gently 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
slipped 1
through 1
There 1
was 1
a 1
little 1
passage 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me 1
unpapered 1
and 1
uncarpeted 1
which 1
turned 1
at 1
a 1
right 1
angle 1
at 1
the 1
farther 1
end 1
Round 1
this 1
corner 1
were 1
three 1
doors 1
in 1
a 1
line 1
the 1
first 1
and 1
third 1
of 1
which 1
were 1
open 1
They 1
each 1
led 1
into 1
an 1
empty 1
room 1
dusty 1
and 1
cheerless 1
with 1
two 1
windows 1
in 1
the 1
one 1
and 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
so 1
thick 1
with 1
dirt 1
that 1
the 1
evening 1
light 1
glimmered 1
dimly 1
through 1
them 1
The 1
centre 1
door 1
was 1
closed 1
and 1
across 1
the 1
outside 1
of 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
fastened 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
broad 1
bars 1
of 1
an 1
iron 1
bed 1
padlocked 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
to 1
a 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
wall 1
and 1
fastened 1
at 1
the 1
other 1
with 1
stout 1
cord 1
The 1
door 1
itself 1
was 1
locked 1
as 1
well 1
and 1
the 1
key 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
This 1
barricaded 1
door 1
corresponded 1
clearly 1
with 1
the 1
shuttered 1
window 1
outside 1
and 1
yet 1
I 1
could 1
see 1
by 1
the 1
glimmer 1
from 1
beneath 1
it 1
that 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
darkness 1
Evidently 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
skylight 1
which 1
let 1
in 1
light 1
from 1
above 1
As 1
I 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
passage 1
gazing 1
at 1
the 1
sinister 1
door 1
and 1
wondering 1
what 1
secret 1
it 1
might 1
veil 1
I 1
suddenly 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
steps 1
within 1
the 1
room 1
and 1
saw 1
a 1
shadow 1
pass 1
backward 1
and 1
forward 1
against 1
the 1
little 1
slit 1
of 1
dim 1
light 1
which 1
shone 1
out 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
door 1
A 1
mad 1
unreasoning 1
terror 1
rose 1
up 1
in 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
My 1
overstrung 1
nerves 1
failed 1
me 1
suddenly 1
and 1
I 1
turned 1
and 1
ran 1
ran 1
as 1
though 1
some 1
dreadful 1
hand 1
were 1
behind 1
me 1
clutching 1
at 1
the 1
skirt 1
of 1
my 1
dress 1
I 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
through 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
straight 1
into 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
who 1
was 1
waiting 1
outside 1
So 1
said 1
he 1
smiling 1
it 1
was 1
you 1
then 1
I 1
thought 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
when 1
I 1
saw 1
the 1
door 1
open 1
Oh 1
I 1
am 1
so 1
frightened 1
I 1
panted 1
My 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
you 1
cannot 1
think 1
how 1
caressing 1
and 1
soothing 1
his 1
manner 1
was 1
and 1
what 1
has 1
frightened 1
you 1
my 1
dear 1
young 1
lady 1
But 1
his 1
voice 1
was 1
just 1
a 1
little 1
too 1
coaxing 1
He 1
overdid 1
it 1
I 1
was 1
keenly 1
on 1
my 1
guard 1
against 1
him 1
I 1
was 1
foolish 1
enough 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
the 1
empty 1
wing 1
I 1
answered 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
lonely 1
and 1
eerie 1
in 1
this 1
dim 1
light 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
frightened 1
and 1
ran 1
out 1
again 1
Oh 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
dreadfully 1
still 1
in 1
there 1
Only 1
that 1
said 1
he 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
keenly 1
Why 1
what 1
did 1
you 1
think 1
I 1
asked 1
Why 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
I 1
lock 1
this 1
door 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
keep 1
people 1
out 1
who 1
have 1
no 1
business 1
there 1
Do 1
you 1
see 1
He 1
was 1
still 1
smiling 1
in 1
the 1
most 1
amiable 1
manner 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
if 1
I 1
had 1
known 1
Well 1
then 1
you 1
know 1
now 1
And 1
if 1
you 1
ever 1
put 1
your 1
foot 1
over 1
that 1
threshold 1
again 1
here 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
the 1
smile 1
hardened 1
into 1
a 1
grin 1
of 1
rage 1
and 1
he 1
glared 1
down 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
demon 1
I 1
ll 1
throw 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
mastiff 1
I 1
was 1
so 1
terrified 1
that 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
I 1
did 1
I 1
suppose 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
have 1
rushed 1
past 1
him 1
into 1
my 1
room 1
I 1
remember 1
nothing 1
until 1
I 1
found 1
myself 1
lying 1
on 1
my 1
bed 1
trembling 1
all 1
over 1
Then 1
I 1
thought 1
of 1
you 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
I 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
there 1
longer 1
without 1
some 1
advice 1
I 1
was 1
frightened 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
the 1
woman 1
of 1
the 1
servants 1
even 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
They 1
were 1
all 1
horrible 1
to 1
me 1
If 1
I 1
could 1
only 1
bring 1
you 1
down 1
all 1
would 1
be 1
well 1
Of 1
course 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
fled 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
my 1
curiosity 1
was 1
almost 1
as 1
strong 1
as 1
my 1
fears 1
My 1
mind 1
was 1
soon 1
made 1
up 1
I 1
would 1
send 1
you 1
a 1
wire 1
I 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
hat 1
and 1
cloak 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
office 1
which 1
is 1
about 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
then 1
returned 1
feeling 1
very 1
much 1
easier 1
A 1
horrible 1
doubt 1
came 1
into 1
my 1
mind 1
as 1
I 1
approached 1
the 1
door 1
lest 1
the 1
dog 1
might 1
be 1
loose 1
but 1
I 1
remembered 1
that 1
Toller 1
had 1
drunk 1
himself 1
into 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
insensibility 1
that 1
evening 1
and 1
I 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
household 1
who 1
had 1
any 1
influence 1
with 1
the 1
savage 1
creature 1
or 1
who 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
set 1
him 1
free 1
I 1
slipped 1
in 1
in 1
safety 1
and 1
lay 1
awake 1
half 1
the 1
night 1
in 1
my 1
joy 1
at 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
seeing 1
you 1
I 1
had 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
getting 1
leave 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
Winchester 1
this 1
morning 1
but 1
I 1
must 1
be 1
back 1
before 1
three 1
o 1
clock 1
for 1
Mr 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
are 1
going 1
on 1
a 1
visit 1
and 1
will 1
be 1
away 1
all 1
the 1
evening 1
so 1
that 1
I 1
must 1
look 1
after 1
the 1
child 1
Now 1
I 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
all 1
my 1
adventures 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
all 1
means 1
and 1
above 1
all 1
what 1
I 1
should 1
do 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
had 1
listened 1
spellbound 1
to 1
this 1
extraordinary 1
story 1
My 1
friend 1
rose 1
now 1
and 1
paced 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
room 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
his 1
pockets 1
and 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
profound 1
gravity 1
upon 1
his 1
face 1
Is 1
Toller 1
still 1
drunk 1
he 1
asked 1
Yes 1
I 1
heard 1
his 1
wife 1
tell 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
that 1
she 1
could 1
do 1
nothing 1
with 1
him 1
That 1
is 1
well 1
And 1
the 1
Rucastles 1
go 1
out 1
to 1
night 1
Yes 1
Is 1
there 1
a 1
cellar 1
with 1
a 1
good 1
strong 1
lock 1
Yes 1
the 1
wine 1
cellar 1
You 1
seem 1
to 1
me 1
to 1
have 1
acted 1
all 1
through 1
this 1
matter 1
like 1
a 1
very 1
brave 1
and 1
sensible 1
girl 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
Do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
perform 1
one 1
more 1
feat 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
ask 1
it 1
of 1
you 1
if 1
I 1
did 1
not 1
think 1
you 1
a 1
quite 1
exceptional 1
woman 1
I 1
will 1
try 1
What 1
is 1
it 1
We 1
shall 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
by 1
seven 1
o 1
clock 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
I 1
The 1
Rucastles 1
will 1
be 1
gone 1
by 1
that 1
time 1
and 1
Toller 1
will 1
we 1
hope 1
be 1
incapable 1
There 1
only 1
remains 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
who 1
might 1
give 1
the 1
alarm 1
If 1
you 1
could 1
send 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
cellar 1
on 1
some 1
errand 1
and 1
then 1
turn 1
the 1
key 1
upon 1
her 1
you 1
would 1
facilitate 1
matters 1
immensely 1
I 1
will 1
do 1
it 1
Excellent 1
We 1
shall 1
then 1
look 1
thoroughly 1
into 1
the 1
affair 1
Of 1
course 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
feasible 1
explanation 1
You 1
have 1
been 1
brought 1
there 1
to 1
personate 1
someone 1
and 1
the 1
real 1
person 1
is 1
imprisoned 1
in 1
this 1
chamber 1
That 1
is 1
obvious 1
As 1
to 1
who 1
this 1
prisoner 1
is 1
I 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
daughter 1
Miss 1
Alice 1
Rucastle 1
if 1
I 1
remember 1
right 1
who 1
was 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
gone 1
to 1
America 1
You 1
were 1
chosen 1
doubtless 1
as 1
resembling 1
her 1
in 1
height 1
figure 1
and 1
the 1
colour 1
of 1
your 1
hair 1
Hers 1
had 1
been 1
cut 1
off 1
very 1
possibly 1
in 1
some 1
illness 1
through 1
which 1
she 1
has 1
passed 1
and 1
so 1
of 1
course 1
yours 1
had 1
to 1
be 1
sacrificed 1
also 1
By 1
a 1
curious 1
chance 1
you 1
came 1
upon 1
her 1
tresses 1
The 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
road 1
was 1
undoubtedly 1
some 1
friend 1
of 1
hers 1
possibly 1
her 1
fiance 1
and 1
no 1
doubt 1
as 1
you 1
wore 1
the 1
girl 1
s 1
dress 1
and 1
were 1
so 1
like 1
her 1
he 1
was 1
convinced 1
from 1
your 1
laughter 1
whenever 1
he 1
saw 1
you 1
and 1
afterwards 1
from 1
your 1
gesture 1
that 1
Miss 1
Rucastle 1
was 1
perfectly 1
happy 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
no 1
longer 1
desired 1
his 1
attentions 1
The 1
dog 1
is 1
let 1
loose 1
at 1
night 1
to 1
prevent 1
him 1
from 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
communicate 1
with 1
her 1
So 1
much 1
is 1
fairly 1
clear 1
The 1
most 1
serious 1
point 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
is 1
the 1
disposition 1
of 1
the 1
child 1
What 1
on 1
earth 1
has 1
that 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it 1
I 1
ejaculated 1
My 1
dear 1
Watson 1
you 1
as 1
a 1
medical 1
man 1
are 1
continually 1
gaining 1
light 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
tendencies 1
of 1
a 1
child 1
by 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
the 1
parents 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
converse 1
is 1
equally 1
valid 1
I 1
have 1
frequently 1
gained 1
my 1
first 1
real 1
insight 1
into 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
parents 1
by 1
studying 1
their 1
children 1
This 1
child 1
s 1
disposition 1
is 1
abnormally 1
cruel 1
merely 1
for 1
cruelty 1
s 1
sake 1
and 1
whether 1
he 1
derives 1
this 1
from 1
his 1
smiling 1
father 1
as 1
I 1
should 1
suspect 1
or 1
from 1
his 1
mother 1
it 1
bodes 1
evil 1
for 1
the 1
poor 1
girl 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
their 1
power 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
right 1
Mr 1
Holmes 1
cried 1
our 1
client 1
A 1
thousand 1
things 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
which 1
make 1
me 1
certain 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
hit 1
it 1
Oh 1
let 1
us 1
lose 1
not 1
an 1
instant 1
in 1
bringing 1
help 1
to 1
this 1
poor 1
creature 1
We 1
must 1
be 1
circumspect 1
for 1
we 1
are 1
dealing 1
with 1
a 1
very 1
cunning 1
man 1
We 1
can 1
do 1
nothing 1
until 1
seven 1
o 1
clock 1
At 1
that 1
hour 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
long 1
before 1
we 1
solve 1
the 1
mystery 1
We 1
were 1
as 1
good 1
as 1
our 1
word 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
seven 1
when 1
we 1
reached 1
the 1
Copper 1
Beeches 1
having 1
put 1
up 1
our 1
trap 1
at 1
a 1
wayside 1
public 1
house 1
The 1
group 1
of 1
trees 1
with 1
their 1
dark 1
leaves 1
shining 1
like 1
burnished 1
metal 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
setting 1
sun 1
were 1
sufficient 1
to 1
mark 1
the 1
house 1
even 1
had 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
not 1
been 1
standing 1
smiling 1
on 1
the 1
door 1
step 1
Have 1
you 1
managed 1
it 1
asked 1
Holmes 1
A 1
loud 1
thudding 1
noise 1
came 1
from 1
somewhere 1
downstairs 1
That 1
is 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
in 1
the 1
cellar 1
said 1
she 1
Her 1
husband 1
lies 1
snoring 1
on 1
the 1
kitchen 1
rug 1
Here 1
are 1
his 1
keys 1
which 1
are 1
the 1
duplicates 1
of 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
s 1
You 1
have 1
done 1
well 1
indeed 1
cried 1
Holmes 1
with 1
enthusiasm 1
Now 1
lead 1
the 1
way 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
soon 1
see 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
this 1
black 1
business 1
We 1
passed 1
up 1
the 1
stair 1
unlocked 1
the 1
door 1
followed 1
on 1
down 1
a 1
passage 1
and 1
found 1
ourselves 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
barricade 1
which 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
had 1
described 1
Holmes 1
cut 1
the 1
cord 1
and 1
removed 1
the 1
transverse 1
bar 1
Then 1
he 1
tried 1
the 1
various 1
keys 1
in 1
the 1
lock 1
but 1
without 1
success 1
No 1
sound 1
came 1
from 1
within 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
silence 1
Holmes 1
face 1
clouded 1
over 1
I 1
trust 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
too 1
late 1
said 1
he 1
I 1
think 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
better 1
go 1
in 1
without 1
you 1
Now 1
Watson 1
put 1
your 1
shoulder 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
see 1
whether 1
we 1
cannot 1
make 1
our 1
way 1
in 1
It 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
rickety 1
door 1
and 1
gave 1
at 1
once 1
before 1
our 1
united 1
strength 1
Together 1
we 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room 1
It 1
was 1
empty 1
There 1
was 1
no 1
furniture 1
save 1
a 1
little 1
pallet 1
bed 1
a 1
small 1
table 1
and 1
a 1
basketful 1
of 1
linen 1
The 1
skylight 1
above 1
was 1
open 1
and 1
the 1
prisoner 1
gone 1
There 1
has 1
been 1
some 1
villainy 1
here 1
said 1
Holmes 1
this 1
beauty 1
has 1
guessed 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
s 1
intentions 1
and 1
has 1
carried 1
his 1
victim 1
off 1
But 1
how 1
Through 1
the 1
skylight 1
We 1
shall 1
soon 1
see 1
how 1
he 1
managed 1
it 1
He 1
swung 1
himself 1
up 1
onto 1
the 1
roof 1
Ah 1
yes 1
he 1
cried 1
here 1
s 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
long 1
light 1
ladder 1
against 1
the 1
eaves 1
That 1
is 1
how 1
he 1
did 1
it 1
But 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
said 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
the 1
ladder 1
was 1
not 1
there 1
when 1
the 1
Rucastles 1
went 1
away 1
He 1
has 1
come 1
back 1
and 1
done 1
it 1
I 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
clever 1
and 1
dangerous 1
man 1
I 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
very 1
much 1
surprised 1
if 1
this 1
were 1
he 1
whose 1
step 1
I 1
hear 1
now 1
upon 1
the 1
stair 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
well 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
have 1
your 1
pistol 1
ready 1
The 1
words 1
were 1
hardly 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
mouth 1
before 1
a 1
man 1
appeared 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
a 1
very 1
fat 1
and 1
burly 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
heavy 1
stick 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
screamed 1
and 1
shrunk 1
against 1
the 1
wall 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
but 1
Sherlock 1
Holmes 1
sprang 1
forward 1
and 1
confronted 1
him 1
You 1
villain 1
said 1
he 1
where 1
s 1
your 1
daughter 1
The 1
fat 1
man 1
cast 1
his 1
eyes 1
round 1
and 1
then 1
up 1
at 1
the 1
open 1
skylight 1
It 1
is 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
shrieked 1
you 1
thieves 1
Spies 1
and 1
thieves 1
I 1
have 1
caught 1
you 1
have 1
I 1
You 1
are 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
I 1
ll 1
serve 1
you 1
He 1
turned 1
and 1
clattered 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
go 1
He 1
s 1
gone 1
for 1
the 1
dog 1
cried 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
I 1
have 1
my 1
revolver 1
said 1
I 1
Better 1
close 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
cried 1
Holmes 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
rushed 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
together 1
We 1
had 1
hardly 1
reached 1
the 1
hall 1
when 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
baying 1
of 1
a 1
hound 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
scream 1
of 1
agony 1
with 1
a 1
horrible 1
worrying 1
sound 1
which 1
it 1
was 1
dreadful 1
to 1
listen 1
to 1
An 1
elderly 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
red 1
face 1
and 1
shaking 1
limbs 1
came 1
staggering 1
out 1
at 1
a 1
side 1
door 1
My 1
God 1
he 1
cried 1
Someone 1
has 1
loosed 1
the 1
dog 1
It 1
s 1
not 1
been 1
fed 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
Quick 1
quick 1
or 1
it 1
ll 1
be 1
too 1
late 1
Holmes 1
and 1
I 1
rushed 1
out 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
angle 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
with 1
Toller 1
hurrying 1
behind 1
us 1
There 1
was 1
the 1
huge 1
famished 1
brute 1
its 1
black 1
muzzle 1
buried 1
in 1
Rucastle 1
s 1
throat 1
while 1
he 1
writhed 1
and 1
screamed 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
Running 1
up 1
I 1
blew 1
its 1
brains 1
out 1
and 1
it 1
fell 1
over 1
with 1
its 1
keen 1
white 1
teeth 1
still 1
meeting 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
creases 1
of 1
his 1
neck 1
With 1
much 1
labour 1
we 1
separated 1
them 1
and 1
carried 1
him 1
living 1
but 1
horribly 1
mangled 1
into 1
the 1
house 1
We 1
laid 1
him 1
upon 1
the 1
drawing 1
room 1
sofa 1
and 1
having 1
dispatched 1
the 1
sobered 1
Toller 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
news 1
to 1
his 1
wife 1
I 1
did 1
what 1
I 1
could 1
to 1
relieve 1
his 1
pain 1
We 1
were 1
all 1
assembled 1
round 1
him 1
when 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
tall 1
gaunt 1
woman 1
entered 1
the 1
room 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
cried 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
Yes 1
miss 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
let 1
me 1
out 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
back 1
before 1
he 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
you 1
Ah 1
miss 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
pity 1
you 1
didn 1
t 1
let 1
me 1
know 1
what 1
you 1
were 1
planning 1
for 1
I 1
would 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
pains 1
were 1
wasted 1
Ha 1
said 1
Holmes 1
looking 1
keenly 1
at 1
her 1
It 1
is 1
clear 1
that 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
knows 1
more 1
about 1
this 1
matter 1
than 1
anyone 1
else 1
Yes 1
sir 1
I 1
do 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
ready 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
what 1
I 1
know 1
Then 1
pray 1
sit 1
down 1
and 1
let 1
us 1
hear 1
it 1
for 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
points 1
on 1
which 1
I 1
must 1
confess 1
that 1
I 1
am 1
still 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
I 1
will 1
soon 1
make 1
it 1
clear 1
to 1
you 1
said 1
she 1
and 1
I 1
d 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
before 1
now 1
if 1
I 1
could 1
ha 1
got 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
cellar 1
If 1
there 1
s 1
police 1
court 1
business 1
over 1
this 1
you 1
ll 1
remember 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
stood 1
your 1
friend 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
was 1
Miss 1
Alice 1
s 1
friend 1
too 1
She 1
was 1
never 1
happy 1
at 1
home 1
Miss 1
Alice 1
wasn 1
t 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
her 1
father 1
married 1
again 1
She 1
was 1
slighted 1
like 1
and 1
had 1
no 1
say 1
in 1
anything 1
but 1
it 1
never 1
really 1
became 1
bad 1
for 1
her 1
until 1
after 1
she 1
met 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
at 1
a 1
friend 1
s 1
house 1
As 1
well 1
as 1
I 1
could 1
learn 1
Miss 1
Alice 1
had 1
rights 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
by 1
will 1
but 1
she 1
was 1
so 1
quiet 1
and 1
patient 1
she 1
was 1
that 1
she 1
never 1
said 1
a 1
word 1
about 1
them 1
but 1
just 1
left 1
everything 1
in 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
s 1
hands 1
He 1
knew 1
he 1
was 1
safe 1
with 1
her 1
but 1
when 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
a 1
husband 1
coming 1
forward 1
who 1
would 1
ask 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
law 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
then 1
her 1
father 1
thought 1
it 1
time 1
to 1
put 1
a 1
stop 1
on 1
it 1
He 1
wanted 1
her 1
to 1
sign 1
a 1
paper 1
so 1
that 1
whether 1
she 1
married 1
or 1
not 1
he 1
could 1
use 1
her 1
money 1
When 1
she 1
wouldn 1
t 1
do 1
it 1
he 1
kept 1
on 1
worrying 1
her 1
until 1
she 1
got 1
brain 1
fever 1
and 1
for 1
six 1
weeks 1
was 1
at 1
death 1
s 1
door 1
Then 1
she 1
got 1
better 1
at 1
last 1
all 1
worn 1
to 1
a 1
shadow 1
and 1
with 1
her 1
beautiful 1
hair 1
cut 1
off 1
but 1
that 1
didn 1
t 1
make 1
no 1
change 1
in 1
her 1
young 1
man 1
and 1
he 1
stuck 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
true 1
as 1
man 1
could 1
be 1
Ah 1
said 1
Holmes 1
I 1
think 1
that 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
good 1
enough 1
to 1
tell 1
us 1
makes 1
the 1
matter 1
fairly 1
clear 1
and 1
that 1
I 1
can 1
deduce 1
all 1
that 1
remains 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
then 1
I 1
presume 1
took 1
to 1
this 1
system 1
of 1
imprisonment 1
Yes 1
sir 1
And 1
brought 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
down 1
from 1
London 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
disagreeable 1
persistence 1
of 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
That 1
was 1
it 1
sir 1
But 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
being 1
a 1
persevering 1
man 1
as 1
a 1
good 1
seaman 1
should 1
be 1
blockaded 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
having 1
met 1
you 1
succeeded 1
by 1
certain 1
arguments 1
metallic 1
or 1
otherwise 1
in 1
convincing 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
interests 1
were 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
his 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
kind 1
spoken 1
free 1
handed 1
gentleman 1
said 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
serenely 1
And 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
he 1
managed 1
that 1
your 1
good 1
man 1
should 1
have 1
no 1
want 1
of 1
drink 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
ladder 1
should 1
be 1
ready 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
your 1
master 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
You 1
have 1
it 1
sir 1
just 1
as 1
it 1
happened 1
I 1
am 1
sure 1
we 1
owe 1
you 1
an 1
apology 1
Mrs 1
Toller 1
said 1
Holmes 1
for 1
you 1
have 1
certainly 1
cleared 1
up 1
everything 1
which 1
puzzled 1
us 1
And 1
here 1
comes 1
the 1
country 1
surgeon 1
and 1
Mrs 1
Rucastle 1
so 1
I 1
think 1
Watson 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
best 1
escort 1
Miss 1
Hunter 1
back 1
to 1
Winchester 1
as 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
our 1
locus 1
standi 1
now 1
is 1
rather 1
a 1
questionable 1
one 1
And 1
thus 1
was 1
solved 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
the 1
sinister 1
house 1
with 1
the 1
copper 1
beeches 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
Mr 1
Rucastle 1
survived 1
but 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
broken 1
man 1
kept 1
alive 1
solely 1
through 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
his 1
devoted 1
wife 1
They 1
still 1
live 1
with 1
their 1
old 1
servants 1
who 1
probably 1
know 1
so 1
much 1
of 1
Rucastle 1
s 1
past 1
life 1
that 1
he 1
finds 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
part 1
from 1
them 1
Mr 1
Fowler 1
and 1
Miss 1
Rucastle 1
were 1
married 1
by 1
special 1
license 1
in 1
Southampton 1
the 1
day 1
after 1
their 1
flight 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
holder 1
of 1
a 1
government 1
appointment 1
in 1
the 1
island 1
of 1
Mauritius 1
As 1
to 1
Miss 1
Violet 1
Hunter 1
my 1
friend 1
Holmes 1
rather 1
to 1
my 1
disappointment 1
manifested 1
no 1
further 1
interest 1
in 1
her 1
when 1
once 1
she 1
had 1
ceased 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
problems 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
private 1
school 1
at 1
Walsall 1
where 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
she 1
has 1
met 1
with 1
considerable 1
success 1

I 1
knowed 1
he 1
wouldn 1
t 1
mind 1
because 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
nuts 1
for 1
him 1
being 1
a 1
mystery 1
and 1
he 1
d 1
make 1
an 1
adventure 1
out 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
be 1
perfectly 1
satisfied 1
And 1
so 1
it 1
turned 1
out 1
and 1
he 1
let 1
on 1
to 1
be 1
Sid 1
and 1
made 1
things 1
as 1
soft 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
for 1
me 1
And 1
his 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
she 1
said 1
Tom 1
was 1
right 1
about 1
old 1
Miss 1
Watson 1
setting 1
Jim 1
free 1
in 1
her 1
will 1
and 1
so 1
sure 1
enough 1
Tom 1
Sawyer 1
had 1
gone 1
and 1
took 1
all 1
that 1
trouble 1
and 1
bother 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
free 1
nigger 1
free 1
and 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
ever 1
understand 1
before 1
until 1
that 1
minute 1
and 1
that 1
talk 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
help 1
a 1
body 1
set 1
a 1
nigger 1
free 1
with 1
his 1
bringing 1
up 1
Well 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
she 1
said 1
that 1
when 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
wrote 1
to 1
her 1
that 1
Tom 1
and 1
Sid 1
had 1
come 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
safe 1
she 1
says 1
to 1
herself 1
Look 1
at 1
that 1
now 1
I 1
might 1
have 1
expected 1
it 1
letting 1
him 1
go 1
off 1
that 1
way 1
without 1
anybody 1
to 1
watch 1
him 1
So 1
now 1
I 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
trapse 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
eleven 1
hundred 1
mile 1
and 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
that 1
creetur 1
s 1
up 1
to 1
this 1
time 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
I 1
couldn 1
t 1
seem 1
to 1
get 1
any 1
answer 1
out 1
of 1
you 1
about 1
it 1
Why 1
I 1
never 1
heard 1
nothing 1
from 1
you 1
says 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
Well 1
I 1
wonder 1
Why 1
I 1
wrote 1
you 1
twice 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
what 1
you 1
could 1
mean 1
by 1
Sid 1
being 1
here 1
Well 1
I 1
never 1
got 1
em 1
Sis 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
she 1
turns 1
around 1
slow 1
and 1
severe 1
and 1
says 1
You 1
Tom 1
Well 1
what 1
he 1
says 1
kind 1
of 1
pettish 1
Don 1
t 1
you 1
what 1
me 1
you 1
impudent 1
thing 1
hand 1
out 1
them 1
letters 1
What 1
letters 1
Them 1
letters 1
I 1
be 1
bound 1
if 1
I 1
have 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
holt 1
of 1
you 1
I 1
ll 1
They 1
re 1
in 1
the 1
trunk 1
There 1
now 1
And 1
they 1
re 1
just 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
they 1
was 1
when 1
I 1
got 1
them 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
office 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
looked 1
into 1
them 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
touched 1
them 1
But 1
I 1
knowed 1
they 1
d 1
make 1
trouble 1
and 1
I 1
thought 1
if 1
you 1
warn 1
t 1
in 1
no 1
hurry 1
I 1
d 1
Well 1
you 1
do 1
need 1
skinning 1
there 1
ain 1
t 1
no 1
mistake 1
about 1
it 1
And 1
I 1
wrote 1
another 1
one 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
I 1
was 1
coming 1
and 1
I 1
s 1
pose 1
he 1
No 1
it 1
come 1
yesterday 1
I 1
hain 1
t 1
read 1
it 1
yet 1
but 1
it 1
s 1
all 1
right 1
I 1
ve 1
got 1
that 1
one 1
I 1
wanted 1
to 1
offer 1
to 1
bet 1
two 1
dollars 1
she 1
hadn 1
t 1
but 1
I 1
reckoned 1
maybe 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
as 1
safe 1
to 1
not 1
to 1
So 1
I 1
never 1
said 1
nothing 1
CHAPTER 1
THE 1
LAST 1
THE 1
first 1
time 1
I 1
catched 1
Tom 1
private 1
I 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
was 1
his 1
idea 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
evasion 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
d 1
planned 1
to 1
do 1
if 1
the 1
evasion 1
worked 1
all 1
right 1
and 1
he 1
managed 1
to 1
set 1
a 1
nigger 1
free 1
that 1
was 1
already 1
free 1
before 1
And 1
he 1
said 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
planned 1
in 1
his 1
head 1
from 1
the 1
start 1
if 1
we 1
got 1
Jim 1
out 1
all 1
safe 1
was 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
run 1
him 1
down 1
the 1
river 1
on 1
the 1
raft 1
and 1
have 1
adventures 1
plumb 1
to 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
river 1
and 1
then 1
tell 1
him 1
about 1
his 1
being 1
free 1
and 1
take 1
him 1
back 1
up 1
home 1
on 1
a 1
steamboat 1
in 1
style 1
and 1
pay 1
him 1
for 1
his 1
lost 1
time 1
and 1
write 1
word 1
ahead 1
and 1
get 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
niggers 1
around 1
and 1
have 1
them 1
waltz 1
him 1
into 1
town 1
with 1
a 1
torchlight 1
procession 1
and 1
a 1
brass 1
band 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
hero 1
and 1
so 1
would 1
we 1
But 1
I 1
reckoned 1
it 1
was 1
about 1
as 1
well 1
the 1
way 1
it 1
was 1
We 1
had 1
Jim 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
chains 1
in 1
no 1
time 1
and 1
when 1
Aunt 1
Polly 1
and 1
Uncle 1
Silas 1
and 1
Aunt 1
Sally 1
found 1
out 1
how 1
good 1
he 1
helped 1
the 1
doctor 1
nurse 1
Tom 1
they 1
made 1
a 1
heap 1
of 1
fuss 1
over 1
him 1
and 1
fixed 1
him 1
up 1
prime 1
and 1
give 1
him 1
all 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
eat 1
and 1
a 1
good 1
time 1
and 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
And 1
we 1
had 1
him 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
sick 1
room 1
and 1
had 1
a 1
high 1
talk 1
and 1
Tom 1
give 1
Jim 1
forty 1
dollars 1
for 1
being 1
prisoner 1
for 1
us 1
so 1
patient 1
and 1
doing 1
it 1
up 1
so 1
good 1
and 1
Jim 1
was 1
pleased 1
most 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
busted 1
out 1
and 1
says 1
Dah 1

But 1
I 1

him 1
so 1
at 1
